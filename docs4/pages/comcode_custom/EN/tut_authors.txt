There is a permission to allow members to define author profiles that bind to their own member profile. If the 'define an author' page was not entered from a link to define/edit a referenced author, it will default to defining/editing the author of the username of the current user: it is through this that a member defines their own author profile.

To define a profile for another author, it is first necessary to add some author supporting content, and then to choose to define the author from the Admin Zone author management page.

[exp_thumb="Viewing an author profile" float="right"]authors_view[/exp_thumb]
Links are placed on author-supporting content view pages to view details of the content author, as well as in the OCF member profile of a member with a bound author profile.

The 'view an author' screen will display the author profile, as well as downloads that they have been recorded as having authored.

[exp_thumb="Managing/Merging authors" float="left"]authors_manage[/exp_thumb]
The Admin Zone provides an interface for merging authors. This feature is provided as it is likely that different users will refer to authors with slightly different names at the point of submission.
