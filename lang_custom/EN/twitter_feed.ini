BLOCK_twitter_feed_USE=You can display a Twitter Feed on your ocPortal web site.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_api_key=Unless the 'Use Twiter Support Config' option is enabled, you will need to supply your own API key and secret. You can get your key and secret by creating an application on Twitter (http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new). The 'Callback URL' field must be set to the web site base URL (for example: http://www.yourdomain.com). When you've saved, you'll need to change the 'Application type' setting to 'Read and Write'. You don't need to create an access token (ocPortal will negotiate this for you behind-the-scenes). Default: ''.

BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_template_main=If you create your own main template, you can enter the suffix name of your custom main template file. This is the main template where the style template will be added to. Example: if your custom template is named BLOCK_TWITTER_FEED_MyCustomTemplate.tpl, you would enter MyCustomTemplate here. When creating the template, be sure to use the original template file name and append an underscore and your custom name to it. I'm sure it's case sensitive as well. Default: ''.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_template_style=If you create your own style template, you can enter the suffix name of your custom style template file. This is the style template where the actual Twitter provided data will be layed out. Check the 'Twitter Feed Integration Block discussion' topic on the ocPortal.com Forum for documentation of available template variables. Example: if your custom template is named BLOCK_TWITTER_FEED_STYLE_MyCustomStyle.tpl, you would enter MyCustomStyle here. When creating the template, be sure to use the original template file name and append an underscore and your custom name to it. I'm sure it's case sensitive as well. Default: ''.

If no style template is manually defined, style can be chosen by one of three styles: 1 = Twitter-like clone, with user profile details. 2 = Full tweets, no user profile details. 3 = Compact but expandable tweets, no user profile details. If you create a simple template, this is ignored. If you create an advanced template, you can set this to a number or name that is referenced in your template file. See the 'Twitter Feed Integration Block discussion' topic on the ocPortal.com Forum for more documentation. Default: '1'.
CONFIG_OPTION_twitterfeed_update_time=The time in minutes for which the Twitter Feed Integration Block cache lasts. In other words, the Twitter feed is downloaded every X minutes.
CONFIG_OPTION_twitterfeed_use_twitter_support_config=If you enable (check) this option, the block will use the same Twitter API key and secret that is configured for the Twitter Support addon (Admin Zone->Configuration->Feature options->Twitter syndication) if the api_key and api_secret block parameters are blank. If you disable (uncheck) this option, then the Twitter API key and secret must be supplied as block parameters. You can get your key and secret by creating an application on Twitter (http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new).
