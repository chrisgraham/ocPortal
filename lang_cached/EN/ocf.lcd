This may be a violation of your rules, depending which you have chosen, but is often annoying; it can usually easily be noticed just by seeing that two members have the same personality, spelling and language habits, usage patterns and IP address.\n\nIt is worth noting, that you should not be overly suspicious, as members who share some of the listed characteristics, may simply be family members in a household that shares an Internet connection.\n\nThe merge member feature will attempt to reassign everything attached (in any way) to the 'from' member to the 'to' member.";s:8:"DOC_LDAP";s:1007:"If you plan to integrate your website into a corporate network, perhaps as your intranet, you may wish to use the same credentials for users of the website as you do for your other services, such as desktop login.
