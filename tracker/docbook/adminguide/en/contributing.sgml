        <para>
	    It feels great when we get feedback from the user community about
	    how MantisBT boosted their productivity, and benefited their organization.
	    A lot of the feedback I get is via email, some on mailing lists, and some
	    on forums. I would encourage such users to blog about it, tell their
	    friends about MantisBT, and recommend MantisBT to other organizations.
	    MantisBT is driven by it's community, the greater the community, the
	    greater the ideas, the greater of a product it becomes.

        <para>
	    If you have a product that can be integrates with MantisBT to provide
	    a value for MantisBT users, that would be a great place to contribute
	    and benefit both your project's community and the MantisBT community.
	    A great examples in this area are integrations with content management
	    systems (e.g. *Nuke, Xoops), project management (PHPProjekt), and
	    TestLink for Test Management. MantisBT can easily be integrated with
	    projects in any programming language whether it is hosted on the same
	    webserver or anywhere else in the world. This can be achieved through
	    it's SOAP API and MantisConnect client libraries. MantisConnect comes
	    with client libraries and samples in languages like PHP, .NET, Java and
	    Cocoa.
