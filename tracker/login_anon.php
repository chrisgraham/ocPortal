	 * login_anon.php logs a user in anonymously without having to enter a username
	 * or password.
	 *
	 * Depends on two global configuration variables:
	 * allow_anonymous_login - bool which must be true to allow anonymous login.
	 * anonymous_account - name of account to login with.
	 *
	 * TODO:
	 * Check how manage account is impacted.
 	 * Might be extended to allow redirects for bug links etc.
