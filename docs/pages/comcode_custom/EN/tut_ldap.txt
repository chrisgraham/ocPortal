[title="2"]Configuring[/title]

[exp_thumb="Configuring LDAP support" float="right"]ldap_configuration[/exp_thumb]
To use LDAP, you must be using ocPortal's inbuilt forum system, OCF. LDAP is enabled after ocPortal installation, in the Admin Zone Configuration module. You may access the Admin Zone using the 'admin' username that was defined when ocPortal was installed and the username will remain functional even if there are problems with LDAP -- this is so that you may fix settings without having to manually adjust the configuration settings in the ocPortal database.

LDAP is known as a [concept]directory service[/concept], and in theory, all the LDAP servers of the world together form a combined directory. Because of this, each LDAP server is given a position in the directory, specified in the LDAP DN (directory navigation) syntax; this is known as the base-DN, and the system administrator of the network should be able to identify this. The base-DN is usually based on the DNS domain name of the network the LDAP server serves, for example: [tt]dc=intranet,dc=ocportal,dc=com[/tt] might be used for the domain [tt]intranet.ocportal.com[/tt]. It is important to use the DNS of the domain and [b]not[/b] the DNS of the server on the domain.

The configuration requires that you either perform an 'anonymous bind', or provide credentials for a user in the system that has full read access to what ocPortal needs in every account. Whether an 'anonymous bind' will work depends on your network: it noes not work on Active Directory by default, but does on OpenLDAP. The anonymous bind account would need full read access as a specified user would.

The LDAP standard is more concerned with protocol and structure than the actual schema used to hold information. Therefore there are significant differences between implementations, and thus we must consider each a separate case.

[title="3"]Active Directory[/title]

[exp_thumb="Adding a user to Active Directory" float="right"]ldap_adduser[/exp_thumb]
Active Directory is a fundamental part of post-NT Windows networking (at the time of writing, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003). It resides on the [concept]domain controller[/concept](s) of the network, and is an LDAP based system that includes a lot of information, especially users and usergroups.

As Active Directory is so standard across Windows, ocPortal has good support for its schema.

The usergroup, 'Administrators' is mapped to the ocPortal Administrators usergroup.
The usergroup, 'Users' is mapped to the lowest ranking ocPortal member usergroup.

[title="3"]OpenLDAP[/title]

ocPortal supports the [concept]NIS[/concept] (aka [concept]POSIX[/concept]) schema. This is the schema that is installed on the server in order for Linux clients to be able to login using the LDAP database for full credentials. It is possible that there are variations of the schema installed on different networks, therefore it may be necessary to ask ocProducts for [page="site:support"]support[/page] to make sure ocPortal can handle your specific configuration.

The usergroups, 'root' and 'admin', are mapped to the ocPortal Administrators usergroup. The usergroup, 'users' is mapped to the lowest ranking ocPortal member usergroup.

[title="2"]Changed ocPortal behaviour[/title]

[exp_thumb="Synchronising with LDAP (ocPortal doesn't duplicate LDAP information, but some parameters need to be set and clean-ups undertaken, which this tool assists)" float="right"]ldap_sync[/exp_thumb]
When you use ocPortal with LDAP, there are some necessary changes to how ocPortal behaves:
 - Automatic mapping between the standard ocPortal usergroups and LDAP usergroups will be performed, even when the names do not quite correlate. For example, an administrator in LDAP, will be an administrator in ocPortal, automatically
 - Unless you allow it, joining on ocPortal will be disabled, in favour of only allowing new LDAP accounts to be seen. ocPortal assumes all LDAP account management is done elsewhere, and only employs read-only access to the LDAP data
 - It is necessary to use the LDAP synchronisation module to choose which LDAP usergroups will be featured in ocPortal. This is done for reasons of cleanliness: often an LDAP database will consist of many cryptic usergroups that would look out-of-place on the portal
 - When an LDAP user logs in for the first time, ocPortal will ask for some supplementary information them (such as their e-mail address) in order to complete the ocPortal profile. This is because usually LDAP does not hold this data, but ocPortal requires it
 - Passwords and user-names of LDAP users cannot be changed
 - LDAP users may not change their usergroup membership from within ocPortal
 - The 'lost password' feature will not work for LDAP users
