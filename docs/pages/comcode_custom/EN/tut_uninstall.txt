[title sub="Written by Chris Graham, ocProducts"]ocPortal Tutorial: Uninstalling ocPortal from a server[/title]

[box="Important note" width="25em" float="right"]Uninstalling ocPortal will remove all database data, such that it is irrecoverable (unless you have backups). This means that all that will remain of content such as downloads are the actual uploaded files under the 'uploads' directory.[/box]
Removing ocPortal from a hosting account (of your own) is very easy. We provide a script that will remove the ocPortal tables from your database for you, leaving only the ocPortal files, contained neatly within the installation directory.

If you decide to uninstall ocPortal for any reason, you may remove the database data by accessing [tt]<base-url>/uninstall.php[/tt] (e.g. [tt]http://yourdomainname.com/uninstall.php[/tt]), and entering the administration password that you defined during installation.

You may then delete the ocPortal installation directory assuming there is nothing in it that you want to keep yourself.
