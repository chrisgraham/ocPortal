[title sub="Written by Philip Withnall, ocProducts"]ocPortal Tutorial: Access control and privileges[/title]

Any large site will have areas that it wants certain members to be able to access, but not others. For example:
 - Categories of information that are visible to the eyes of members from only one usergroup
 - Pages available only if you're new to the site
ocPortal has a powerful access control and privilege system built into its core
For an overview of the ocPortal permission system, see the 'Advanced configuration' tutorial.

To edit permissions in ocPortal you can either use:
 - The permissions tree editor
 - Manual configuration

{!permissions:DOC_PERMISSIONS_TREE}

The remainder of this section is concerned with manual permission setting.

[title="3"]Editing zone permissions[/title]

[i]This section describes editing from outside the Permissions Tree Editor. It is perhaps easier to centralise control from the Permissions Tree Editor. All the settings described here are also present in the Permissions Tree Editor.[/i]

[exp_thumb="Setting zone permissions" float="left"]permissions_Edit-zone-permissions[/exp_thumb]
You can edit zone permissions by editing the zone for which you want to change the permissions.

Go the Admin Zone, then the 'Structure' section, then the 'Zones' icon. Choose a zone to edit (bear in mind that you can't change permissions for the Welcome Zone, as everybody is allowed to access it), and continue.

[exp_thumb="Choosing a zone to edit" float="right"]permissions_Choose-zone-edit[/exp_thumb]
You will be presented with the zone editing form. Near the bottom are the options for usergroup access permissions: one binary 'can/can't' access permission per usergroup. Toggle the checkboxes as you see fit (if a checkbox is unchecked, the corresponding usergroup can't enter the zone, but if it is checked, the usergroup can enter the zone without problem), and submit the form.

[exp_thumb="Editing page permissions" float="right"]permissions_Page-permissions-grid[/exp_thumb]
Go to the Admin Zone, then the 'Structure' section, then the 'Permissions' icon. Choose 'Page permissions'. To edit a page's permissions manually, you need to go to the page permissions page. Once more, choose a zone to edit, and submit the form. You will be presented with a checkbox-grid of the permissions for every page in your selected zone. Along the top are the names of all the usergroups on your site, and down the side are the names of all the pages in your selected zone. In the middle is a checkbox-grid for the permissions, and down the right is a column of buttons for inverting a whole row of checkboxes at once [[exp_ref]permissions_Mass-checkbox-change[/exp_ref]].

Once all the access permissions are set as appropriate, submit the form.

[title="3"]Editing category permissions[/title]

[exp_thumb="Editing category permissions" float="left"]permissions_Edit-category-permissions[/exp_thumb]
Usergroup access permissions exist for just about any type of category ocPortal provides: from calendar entry types to news categories, you can easily set the usergroup access permissions through the category edit page. In this example, we'll change the usergroup access permissions for a news category.

Go to the Content Management Zone. Choose the icon for the content type you want to edit. Click the 'Edit one category' icon. Select the category to edit, and submit the form.

Then, set the permissions as necessary, and submit the form once more.
[exp_thumb="Choosing a category to edit" float="right"]permissions_Choose-category-edit[/exp_thumb]

The process is the same for editing the permissions of any type of category.

[title="3"]Match-key permissions[/title]

[title="2"]Privileges[/title]

[exp_thumb="Choosing a privilege section to edit permissions within" float="right"]permissions_Choose-specific-access[/exp_thumb]
{!permissions:DOC_PRIVILEGES}

The privileges are accessed through the "privileges" page. On this page is a list of permission sections; all the privileges are grouped into related sections for ease-of-configuration. Choose a section, and submit the form to see and change the related privileges. The page shows a checkbox-grid of the usergroups and the privileges in your selected section. Set up the privileges as appropriate, and submit the form to change them.

For a good real-world example of how to set up privileges, see the 'Setting bypass-validation access' section of the [page="tut_forums"]organising discussion forums[/page] tutorial.

[title="2"]Adding, Editing and Deleting content[/title]

To submit/edit/delete you need the correct privileges. You also need view permission all the way to the page that does it, in the CMS zone.

Here is a worked example of how to set view and privilege permissions to submit to a links catalogue category.

As view permissions work on a basis of needing to get past successive barriers, you need to have view permissions assigned to all of the following barriers to submit:
 - CMS zone
 - cms_catalogues page (by default all pages have view access)

Of course, if you want people to be able to submit, you probably also want them to be able to view. You'd need view permissions assigned to all of the following barriers to view:
 - Site zone
 - catalogues page (by default all pages have view access)
 - Links catalogue
 - category

Privileges on the other hand are inherited all the way from the global privileges. You don't need to set them at all if they are set in the global privileges and you haven't set up any overrides. However you would be able to set overrides on the Links catalogue itself, and the particular category you might want to allow/disallow links to be submitted to, should you wish to have more fine-grained control.

Note that privileges are not inherited through category trees, so setting privileges on a parent category will not change privilege to the child categories. If you wanted whole subtrees of categories to have different privileges you'd need to use the batch selection feature in the Permission Tree Editor. It is rare to want to be able to do this though.

Similarly, you do not need view permissiosn on parent categories to view child categories, although it would be hard to find a category if you did not have access to view it's parents.

[title="2"]Testing access and privileges[/title]

[exp_thumb="The SU feature is incredibly quick and easy: just enter a name and click a button" float="left"]permissions_Su[/exp_thumb]
To test access permissions and privileges, it's best to create a test user, or to assume the identity of a lower-ranking (non-administrator) member. This section is concerned with the use of the 'su' function.

[exp_thumb="Setting privileges" float="right"]permissions_Edit-specific-access[/exp_thumb]
The 'su' function allows an administrator to quickly and easily assume the identity of somebody else, for whatever nefarious or benevolent purposes he sees fit. To use 'su', simply enter the name of the member whose identity you would like to assume into the 'su' box (in the footer), and press the enter/return key. A new window will open, presenting the same screen as seen by the specified user. You can navigate around as this user, experiencing the site through his/her eyes (so to speak), as all the permissions are as they are for this normal user. This can easily and effectively be used to test out permissions changes to make sure they are as required.

Please note that when using 'su':
 - the member will not show as being 'online' in most contexts
 - (by design) you will still be able to access a closed site, and view permission diagnostics using FirePHP

[title="3"]Debugging permission problems[/title]

ocPortal has a special feature to help you diagnose problems with your permission settings.
1) To use this feature you need to be using [url="Firefox"]http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/[/url] and have the [url="Firebug"]https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843[/url] and [url="FirePHP"]https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6149[/url] addons installed
2) Once the addons are both installed, make sure that all the debugging panes (Console, HTML, CSS, Script, DOM, Net) for Firebug are enabled for your website (to bring up Firebug click the bug icon in the tray of icons in the bottom right of the browser)
3) Bring up your website and add [tt]&keep_firephp=1[/tt] to the end of the URL
You will then find that details of all the permission checks, templates, and queries, used to generate the ocPortal screen are logged to the Firebug/FirePHP Console. By looking to see what permission checks pass or fail you can work out what settings you might want to change.

You can also create a writable [tt]data_custom/permissioncheckslog.php[/tt] file, and all failed permission checks will be logged to it. Just don't leave the file there or it'll get very big, very fast.

[title="4"]Refreshing forms[/title]

Be aware that privilege changes may require refreshing of any currently-open forms where the privilege may be used.
For example, bypass-validation privileges add a checkbox to the form, and if the privilege is not enabled that checkbox will not be there. When the form is submitted ocPortal requires that checkbox to be checked, in addition to the secure re-testing of access that will happen automatically at this point.

[title="2"]Adding a new usergroup for a non-OCF site[/title]

If you are not using [concept]OCF[/concept] and decide to add a new usergroup, then ocPortal will not have any permissions associated with it.
Fortunately ocPortal has a special feature for this situation: under the 'Security' section of the Admin Zone you will find an icon for it, 'Absorb usergroup-permissions'. You may use this feature to take the permissions of an existing usergroup and copy them so that the new usergroup has those same permissions.
