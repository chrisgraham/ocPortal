[title sub="Written by Chris Graham, ocProducts"]ocPortal Tutorial: Tempcode programming[/title]

Tempcode is ocPortal's template programming language. On the simplest level, it provides a substitution mechanism so that parameters and global symbols (like the current user's username, or the time) can be inserted into a template. It also serves as a complete programming language with a powerful set of control mechanisms.

[title="2"]Philosophy[/title]

Most templating languages will try to either:
 - use XML, to add programming constructs into the mark-up itself
 - allow PHP code, or an abstraction of PHP code, to run within the templates

Our approach is distinctly different, as we uphold four strong principles:
 - templates should be editable in an HTML editor without Tempcode being broken (although the HTML editor at this time must be able to support 'fragments of HTML')
 - templates should not contain code on the same level as PHP, for security reasons (a theme should not be able to delete files, for instance)
 - there should be a very clear separation of role between templates and code; code should not be put into templates simply because it is convenient, as this muddies the architecture, causing maintenance issues
 - templates should not 'execute': Tempcode should act as a filter/token-placer for output, reshaping output, rather than intertwining code with it. This is again, an architectural issue

Due to our design principles, Tempcode is a very unusual language, with a very simple syntax.

[title="3"]Advanced philosophy (experts only)[/title]

For those interested in 'programming language semantics', Tempcode is neither a functional or imperative language, but has aspects of both. A functional language essentially is focused on output being controlled by a complex mathematical expression. An imperative language essentially is focused on output being controlled by a sequence of commands. With Tempcode, output is focused on the stream of text coming from a template, and the composition of these streams; 'symbols' and 'directives' can control, manipulate and add to the stream, but they are more like embedded functional-language function-chains and control-tags than imperative code. Sequences of commands can be simulated by placing symbols and directives next to each other in the output stream and using variable manipulation features to bridge data across the portions of the output stream.

Popular template languages such as 'Velocity' or 'Smarty' are able (and often used) to function in a similar sense to this, but their language design is imperative at core, and the result simply is just far less elegant. Tempcode just 'feels right', with its clean syntax and PHP-separation, whilst other languages look literally like conventional programming code has been added inside the template in an ad-hoc way (even if the full programming syntax has been simplified a bit).

[title="2"]Syntax[/title]

Tempcode provides four constructs other than the plain text of the template itself:
 - [b]Parameters[/b]: [tt]{PARAMETER}[/tt] where PARAMETER is a code-name of something that was actually passed to the template
 - [b]Language strings[/b]: [tt]{!STRING,<parameters>...}[/tt] where STRING is a real language string from a loaded language file (e.g. Banner code could use strings from banners.ini, but most other code could not; global.ini contains strings usable anywhere)
 - [b]Symbols[/b]: [tt]{$SYMBOL,<parameters>...}[/tt] where SYMBOL is a real symbol ocPortal supports. Embedding a symbol is like making a function call or running a command in the complex place, or a substitution in the simple case
 - [b]Directives[/b]: [tt]{+START,DIRECTIVE,<parameters>...}...{+END,DIRECTIVE}[/tt] where DIRECTIVE is a real directive ocPortal supports. Directives essentially wrap portions of the template, controlling that portion; they are generally used for types of condition checking (e.g. IF) or loop. There are also directives like [tt]{+IMPLODE,<parameters>...}[/tt] that do not wrap, but work outside the normal "string manipulation" bounds that symbols do

Any Tempcode construct may be escaped (made to fit in an encoding scheme, such as HTML or  URLs, such that special text characters do not interact with that encoding scheme in an insecure/corrupting way) by escaping filters with ease, just by placing the symbol associated with the mode of escaping before the closing '}'. The following escaping filters are provided:
[list="x"]
[*][tt]*[/tt] HTML   (or [tt]=[/tt] if you are 100% sure you want the data escaping, even if it comes from something that might already be in HTML)
	(e.g. [tt]Hello & Goodbye[/tt]  [html]&rarr;[/html]  [tt]Hello &amp; Goodbye[/tt])
[*][tt];[/tt] Between single quotes
	(e.g. [tt]Who's here[/tt]  [html]&rarr;[/html]  [tt]Who\'s here[/tt])
[*][tt]#[/tt] Between double quotes
	(e.g. [tt]She said, 'Hello'[/tt]  [html]&rarr;[/html]  [tt]She said, \'Hello\'[/tt])
[*][tt]~[/tt] Where new lines are not allowed
	(text is drawn up to reside on a single line)
[*][tt]@[/tt] Comcode
	(e.g. [tt]Use the \[url] tag[/tt]  [html]&rarr;[/html]  [tt]Use the \\\[url] tag[/tt])
[*][tt]'[/tt] CSS
	(anything that isn't a part of a very constrained non-string value is stripped)
[*][tt]/[/tt] Special Javascript SGML-issue
	(e.g. [tt]print('</p>');[/tt]  [html]&rarr;[/html]  [tt]print('<\/p')[/tt])
[*][tt]^[/tt] Where new lines become '\n'
	(multiple lines drawn together with [tt]\n[/tt] as a separator)
[*][tt]&[/tt] URL parameters   (or [tt].[/tt] if you don't want extra ocPortal URL escaping to happen)
	(e.g. [tt]a&b[/tt]  [html]&rarr;[/html]  [tt]a%26b[/tt])
[*][tt]|[/tt] Javascript IDs
	(e.g. [tt]This is a -terrible- ID[/tt]  [html]&rarr;[/html]  [tt]This__is__a____terrible____ID[/tt])
[*][tt]%[/tt] Strict codenames
	(e.g. [tt]ThiS[/tt] [html]&rarr;[/html] [tt]ThiS[/tt]   [i]but[/i]  [tt]This is[/tt]  --> \[\[hack attack]] triggered)
[/list]
You can also use [tt]-[/tt] to indicate that a symbol should not be pre-processed, which is very occasionally useful if you want to stop something like a block being preloaded if it is buried under a Tempcode IF directive and hence doesn't always run. Stopping pre-processing will stop any Javascript or [abbr="Cascading Style Sheets"]CSS[/abbr] dependencies being called up, however.

It is absolutely crucial that Tempcode programmers use the proper escaping. Without it, all kinds of insecurities and unreliabilities can develop. About 50% of parameters in the default ocPortal templates actually use HTML escaping so that plain text placed inside a template does not interfere with the HTML structure itself and displays literally.

[title="2"]The Tempcode tree[/title]

Templates are composed together into a tree structure, and then the tree structure is output. This is discussed in further detail in the 'site structure' tutorial.

[title="2"]Placing theme images[/title]

To insert an image into your template, use ocPortal's image parameter: [tt]{$IMG,codename}[/tt]. Replace [tt]codename[/tt] with the image code for the image you want to use. This will turn into the image's URL. Be aware that this does not insert any HTML for you, so to use it fully:
[code]<img src="{$IMG,page/delete}" alt="Delete This" title="Delete This" />[/code]
This would insert the image [tt]http://www.mywebsite.com/themes/default/images/page/EN/delete.png[/tt] into your page.
[staff_note][html]<img src="[/html]{$IMG,page/delete}[html]" alt="Delete This" title="Delete This" />[/html][/staff_note]

The advantage to using the ocPortal code instead of hand coding the image is two-fold. First, you'll notice that it is able to automatically detect the theme and language that is currently in use (in this case, the default theme and English). Secondly, if you ever move the image, you don't have to edit every page that ever used it to point to the new location. You can edit images from within the themes management screen (go to the "Styles" section of the Admin Zone, then the "Themes" icon).

[title="2"]Numbers and logic[/title]

Tempcode is an entirely string based language. It does, however, provide significant logic and number functionality, which is made possible by conversion from text as symbols require. Numbers are read directly, and should not contain any special formatting other than the British English decimal point (.) symbol. 'True' is encoded as '1' and 'False' is encoded as '0'.

[title="2"]Symbols[/title]

[title="3"]Notes[/title]

If a symbol is missing important parameters, it generally is skipped.

Some of the more advanced symbols are not fully laid-out, but they are all defined in [tt]sources/symbols.php[/tt] in an obvious way, so advanced users can read this file.

You are very unlikely to ever want to use rows in red, as they are intended for use by core ocPortal code.

Tempcode does not have explicit data-types, everything is text. However we may interpret the text in symbols as follows:
 - Tempcode number: the text is assumed to be a number written as a normal decimal string (e.g. 12345)
 - Tempcode boolean: the text is assumed to be 0 (meaning false) or 1 (meaning true)

Permission checks are useful if you want to show screen contents in a way that somehow reflects your configured permission scheme.
These are advanced symbols, and mirror ocPortal's internal API. The parameters are not discussed here, but you may find them from looking at the code.

[title="4"]Thumbnail generation[/title]

The [tt]{$THUMBNAIL}[/tt] tag is actually much more sophisticated and powerful than described above. It's full syntax is as follows...

Usage: [tt]{$THUMBNAIL,source_image,widthxheight,output_dir,filename,fallback_image,type,where,background,only_make_smaller}[/tt]
where:
 - source_image is the URL to the full image
 - widthxheight is the desired width/height for the thumbnail. For types (see below) of width or height or crop you can omit either of the width or height for automatically calculated proportionality (e.g. [tt]x20[/tt] for just a height). If you specify both for crop it crops to the exact specified box rather than to the implied proportional box.
 - output_dir is the name of a directory under ocPortal's "uploads" directory
 - filename is the name of the thumbnail filename. If not provided it will be automatically chosen based on the source_image and an articulation of the thumbnail settings
 - fallback_image is the URL to the image to use if no thumbnail could be generated. If not provided the source_image will be used
 - type is either:
  - "width" for an image which is stretched to the given width and a height in proportion to that
  - "height" for an image which is stretched to the given height and a width in proportion to that
  - "crop" for an image which has been shrunk until one of its dimensions matched that given and the rest has been chopped off
  - "pad" for an image which has been shrunk until it completely fits within the given dimensions, and then padded out
  - "pad_vert_crop_vert" for an image that may only have cropping or padding done above/below and therefore gets stretched to force that to be the case
  - "pad_horiz_crop_horiz" for an image that may only have cropping or padding done left/right and therefore gets stretched to force that to be the case
 - The "where" argument is not needed for "width" or "height" type thumbnails. For "crop" & "pad" types it is where to crop/pad:
  - "start"
  - "end"
  - "both" (assuming bottom-to-top and right-to-left)
  - If the "where" option is ommitted for cropped thumbnails then it will be centred. For padded thumbnails it will resize the image to get rid of any need for padding (ie. "padding none").
 - For "pad" types the background is used to pad the image:
  - a hex code for a specific color (with alpha)
  - or, "none" for no padding (ie. the image dimensions are not those given, but will fit inside them).
  - or, if the option is omitted for padded thumbnails then the average color of the image is used.
 - only_make_smaller can be set to "1" if the image should not be resized at all if it is already smaller than the requested thumbnail size

[title="3"]Logic[/title]

Note that all logic symbols return Tempcode boolean values (except [tt]?[/tt]). This makes them suitable for nesting with each other, or using with the 'IF' directive.
Understanding of these symbols requires an understanding of basic boolean operations but they are fairly intuitive (e.g. 'AND' will return true if all its parameters are true).

[title="3"]Tempcode variables[/title]

You can store and retrieve values in Tempcode variables. These work across templates, and also work in any-order due to the ocPortal Tempcode pre-processor (i.e. something can be [tt]SET[/tt] after the [tt]GET[/tt] for it).

Bear in mind that the ocPortal Tempcode-preprocessor will likely cause your code to run once in every code branch before it outputs (meaning even code inside IF directives that never are true will still pre-process), and once again as it outputs. So always reinitialise your variables in your template to make sure they are not dirty from the pre-processing stage. This behaviour may seem strange, but it is necessary for performance, comprehensive caching, and reasons of ocPortal needing conditionless output foresight.</td>

[title="2"]Examples[/title]

The most important directives are:
 - IF_NON_EMPTY
 - IF_EMPTY
 - IF

[title="3"]IF_NON_EMPTY[/title]

This directive is commonly used when a box or explanation needs placing around something, unless that something happens to be blank (empty).
For example, the following is a fairly typical thing to see in a template:
[codebox]
{+START,IF_NON_EMPTY,{DOWNLOADS}}
	<p>We have the following downloads:</p>
	{DOWNLOADS}
{+END}
[/codebox]

The [tt]IF_NON_EMPTY[/tt] template evaluates [tt]{DOWNLOADS}[/tt], to see if it is blank. If it is not blank, the contents of the directive is output, otherwise nothing happens.
As you can see from this example, we need to check for emptyness so we don't show a boxed message about downloads that refers to nothingness.

[title="3"]IF_EMPTY[/title]

An alternative approach to the above example is to include a special message upon emptyness, rather than skipping over. We might do this if the content being displayed is critical and thus the emptyness must be explicitly acknowledged:
[codebox]
<p>We have the following downloads:</p>
{DOWNLOADS}
{+START,IF_EMPTY,{DOWNLOADS}}
	<p class="nothing_here">(none)</p>
{+END}
[/codebox]

Note here how we are displaying [tt]{DOWNLOADS}[/tt] even if it is empty. Obviously if it is empty, nothing would display, so we can get away with it. If we were being pedantic we might have wrote the following:
[codebox]
<p>We have the following downloads:</p>
{+START,IF_NON_EMPTY,{DOWNLOADS}}
	{DOWNLOADS}
{+END}
{+START,IF_EMPTY,{DOWNLOADS}}
	<p class="nothing_here">(none)</p>
{+END}
[/codebox]
and arguably this does better demonstrate what we're trying to do, even though the behaviour is the same (ignoring invisible differences in HTML white-space).

It's often useful to be a bit clever with the emptyness-checking directives. For example:
[codebox]
<p>We have the following downloads and images:</p>
{DOWNLOADS}
{IMAGES}
{+START,IF_EMPTY,{DOWNLOADS}{IMAGES}}
	<p class="nothing_here">(none)</p>
{+END}
[/codebox]

In this example, the directive checks if the [tt]{DOWNLOADS}{IMAGES}[/tt] is blank, which is exactly the same as checking if they are both blank (because blank next to blank is still just blank).

[title="3"]IF[/title]

The 'IF' directive allows particular complex calculations to be done. For a simple example, we can replicate the trick in the last example in a more formal way:
[codebox]
<p>We have the following downloads and images:</p>
{DOWNLOADS}
{IMAGES}
{+START,IF,{$AND,{$IS_EMPTY,{DOWNLOADS}},{$IS_EMPTY,{IMAGES}}}}
	<p class="nothing_here">(none)</p>
{+END}
[/codebox]

This checks to see if "DOWNLOADS is empty and IMAGES is empty".

Tempcode uses what is called a "prefix notation", and is similar to the way you write mathematical functions. For example, in common maths:
[code]
f(a,b)
[/code]
is how you would write "evaluate function 'f' with parameters 'a' and 'b'.
In the similar Tempcode notation you would write (assuming 'A' and 'B' are template parameters and 'F' is a real Tempcode symbol):
[code]
{$F,{A},{B}}
[/code]

Here's another 'IF' directive showing a more complex computation:
[codebox]
{+START,IF,{$LT,{ADD_DATE_RAW},{$SUBTRACT,{$FROM_TIMESTAMP},86400}}}
	<p>This content on {$SITE_NAME} is more than one day old.</p>
{+END}
[/codebox]

Background: a unix timestamp is a common measurement of time on computers- it represents the number of seconds since 1970 and because of its nature as a simple decimal number, is very useful for performing arithmetic.
This example checks to see if [tt]ADD_DATE_RAW[/tt] is less than the current unix timestamp minus 86400. 86400 is the number of seconds in a day, so in other words the example checks to see if [tt]ADD_DATE_RAW[/tt] is at least a day in the past. Because [tt]ADD_DATE_RAW[/tt] is often passed into templates that display content, it checks to see if the content is at least a day old.

I threw [tt]{$SITE_NAME}[/tt] into the example just to demonstrate symbols are not only for use in IF directives- this one is being used to perform a simple placement of the website name. All symbols do is compute results, so those results might be used for further computations as parameters to computational symbols (such as 'SUBTRACT'), or they might be passed into a directive, or they might be simply output. It merely depends on where they are placed.

Tempcode is extremely powerful, and hopefully now you can see how symbols, directives, and parameters, can come together to allow great things to happen!

[title="2"]GUIDs[/title]

There is a design issue that comes to us when we design template structure... do we re-use templates so that editing is easier, load is decreased, and consistency is raised; or do we allow maximum customisation of different aspects of the system by not re-using templates?
We have tended to stick to a middle ground between these extremes, and re-used templates when the usage pattern was almost identical. For example, almost all of ocPortal uses the same form field templates, but Wiki+ posts use different templates to forum posts. However, there are still places where we re-use templates in situations that sites may wish to develop in separate directions.

The solution to this is to make use of the GUID each template usage is given when it is used.
Each 'do_template' call in ocPortal, which loads up a template, passes in a parameter, '_GUID'. The GUIDs may then be used along with tempcode directives to control what the template outputs.
The template editor has special support for the GUIDs, showing what GUIDs a template is used with and providing links to view the code associated with each GUID. It also provides a feature to automatically insert an 'IF' directive that differentiates against one of the GUIDs to provide a place to put output that will only be shown for it.

If you enter the template editor from the 'Template tree' screen then you will be told the GUID that was used by the node in the tree that you selected.

 2_key="parameter"        2_value="A parameter to a template; only parameters that the code calling the template supports may be used"
 3_key="directive"        3_value="A tool used to surround an area of a template between a START and an END, to apply something to it (such as only using it conditionally)"
 4_key="variable"         4_value="Two uses: 1) Either of a parameter, symbol, directive or language string reference. 2) A named piece of memory used by Tempcode symbols that manipulate variables."
