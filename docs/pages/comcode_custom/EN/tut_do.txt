[title="2"]Do[/title]

 - Use a clear colour scheme that is easy on the eyes
 - Make it easy to navigate your site: people should not need to think to find where to go, it should be obvious
 - Provide good, fresh, and new content on your site; or if you are making an aggregation site, content that is organised in a unique way

[title="2"]Do not[/title]

 - Make a website that is too busy, as it will be slow and will distract from your site message
 - Use every ocPortal feature on your site just because they exist
 - Plagiarise content: if you use other peoples content, credit them
