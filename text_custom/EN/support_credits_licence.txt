The support ticket system was designed for users who are able to budget for professional web services. By purchasing you acknowledge that you have evaluated this commercial service suitable and priced for your needs. More information about how our services are designed is available from the following URL: http://ocportal.com/forum/topicview/misc/10111.htm

Please read through the following terms and conditions carefully. These terms apply to all our paid online support ticket services. By making this purchase you are agreeing to these binding terms and conditions. This is an agreement between you (the customer) and ocProducts Ltd or partners of ocProducts (ocProducts).

You are over the age of 16 or have the consent of a legal guardian.

You are making the payment with your own funds, or have authorisation from the fund owner who has also agreed to these terms and conditions.

You are purchasing a number of virtual "credits" for use solely in the ocProducts support ticket system. These credits are non-transferrable and after 7 days from purchasing, non-refundable. If you require a refund within 7 days it must be requested clearly, and can only be performed on unused credits. After payment has been confirmed as cleared to our bank/Paypal account you will be able to "spend" the credits on the services ocProducts advertises.

Credits are "charged" from customer's member accounts based upon the work performed by ocProducts. This work is done on good faith based on the stated requirements of our customers. It is the responsibility of customers to communicate all essential details of work, as ocProducts can not refund based on miscommunicated, ambiguous, or incomplete requirements.

If a customer asks ocProducts to perform work without first establishing a quote or establishing a limit then the customer implies he or she understands that there is no imposed limit on what the credit charge for the work may come to, other than the limit implied by the number of remaining credits that the customer has. ocProducts will not intentionally take an excessive amount of time on a job and thus charge an excessive number of credits, but ocProducts is not responsible for any incorrect assumptions on the part of the customer.

If a customer asks for work to be stopped part way through it being carried out ocProducts reserves the right to charge credits for the work in full.

A stated minimum credit cost may apply to work done. This cost is per action, not per ticket. This cost reflects the organisational cost required in operating the support ticket system, and our need to be able to schedule our staff and partner working day into blocks.

ocProducts may provide a number of different service levels, with different hourly unit costs depending on the service level. Service level response times are set based on when work begins, not when it concludes. If ocProducts are not able to start providing a requested service level then ocProducts will discount the credit cost to the closest matching lower service level. 

ocProducts provides no guarantees that service levels, operating procedures, staffing, or credit costs, will not change, other than that the budget-level time-value of each credit will not decrease for credits already purchased.

ocProducts reserves the right to expire (without refund) purchased credits that are not used within two years of their purchase date, at their discretion.

Service level response times are based on working hours, unless otherwise stated. ocProducts reserves the right to change working hours, or to operate different working hours for different services, service levels, or regions. Working hours at the time of writing these conditions are Mon-Fri 9:30am-5:30pm UK time (GMT/BST), but may be different at the time of reading.

The copyright to all new features developed becomes property of ocProducts (only software features, not design work, copy, or other materials), unless otherwise agreed; customers should expect that features become available for all users in future versions of ocPortal.

Customers should be fluent in English. ocProducts cannot be held responsible for mistakes made due to language barriers.

Work must be carried out entirely within the support ticket system - no e-mail or phone support is provided. This is to keep our management costs down. If you can us we are likely to politely discuss current staff availability and direct you to make your request via a support ticket.

ocProducts will often summarise an expected development schedule, however unless ocProducts agrees in advance, no such schedule will be binding. Unless agreed in advance, ocProducts will not be subject to a client's own proposed/internal schedule.

If a customer intends to be involved deeply with the design process (i.e. creating diagrams for ocProducts to implement against), it is necessary that ocProducts is informed of this at an early juncture. If the design will add new requirements (as explained per some of the terms above) the design should happen before a quote is agreed and before ocProducts begins any development; otherwise ocProducts must be kept fully abreast of what designs are to be done by the customer and when they will be sent, so ocProducts can make sure that our own work is kept consistent and thus avoid having to back-track.

If upgrading costs have not explicitly been quoted-for customers may require extra paid help if customers wish to upgrade to a future version of ocPortal. New developed features can potentially interfere with the normal upgrade process.

If ocProducts has to fix problems caused by mis-configurations of ocPortal by the client it may incur a credit cost.

The quote will be based on a list of features required for development and other expected work. The customer implies agreement to a list and a quote once development proceeds. If it turns out the agreed list was insufficient (even if a missing feature is obvious from the client point of view, it may well not be from ocProducts, because ocProducts does not necessarily have the insight into how features will be used), an additional round of (credit-costing) work will be required. This additional round may be immediate, but it may also be based on ocProducts availability.

The customer should assume that ocProducts intends to implement any specified feature in the easiest (from ocProducts perspective) way consistent with how it is described, so long as the implementation is of a reasonable inherent quality. Therefore it is essential that any key details are explained in advance, so that they can built into the quote.

Example: if ocProducts is asked to include information on a site about something, ocProducts might assume it would all be put on one page, and thus our quote would not cover implementation across multiple pages.

Example: if ocProducts is only asked to place news on a home page, more complex requirements such as placing different news categories in different tabs of a news box would not be covered.

Example: ocProducts would assume ocPortal's standard breadcrumb functionality is sufficient unless given information indicating otherwise, so any breadcrumb navigation system inconsistent with ocPortal's standard would not be covered by the quote. This applies to other standard ocPortal features.

The project will not include changes to existing ocPortal features unless those changes have been explicitly included in the quote. If the customer has not tested the ocPortal features to make sure they are appropriate, they should expect that additional (credit-costing) work may be required.

If the customer requires any extra steps in the production process it is necessary for the customer to say so before a quote is agreed. For example, if a customer needs multiple demo update phases due to having a tiered internal review process then this will incur a cost and thus ocProducts must factor it in.

ocProducts is not responsible for problems outside the scope of work, such as hardware or network problems, corrupted web browser installs, or faulty beta software. ocProducts can only attempt to fix them if paid appropriately and given sufficient access.

ocProducts disclaims all liability to incidental or consequential damages which arise from the work carried out. ocProducts does not offer any legal warranty. ocProducts cannot be held liable for any court or solicitor fees, or be considered liable for damages/claims/costs/fees/expenses in any court case made against the customer. No indemnity is provided.
