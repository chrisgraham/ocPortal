[title="1"]Edit quotes[/title]

These quotes are the default quotes fed into the [tt]main_quotes[/tt] block, which is a block designed to show a random quote from the selection defined.
Place each new quote on a separate line.

Please note that this editing page is just a Comcode page set-up to edit the [tt]quotes[/tt] text-file, and the use of the [tt]quotes[/tt] file with the [tt]main_quotes[/tt] block is just a default -- you may have multiple quote blocks using multiple quote files, if you wish. If you wish to be able to edit all quote files from within this editor, click 'Edit page' below and add in new [tt]main_notes[/tt] blocks.
