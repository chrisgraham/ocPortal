DOC_CLEANUP_TOOLS=The website cleanup tools page will allow you to empty any website cache, as well as automatically locate and repair common problems, and remove any orphaned data. There are a number of cleanup tools, which are run individually; ideally none ever need to be used, but if things happen outside the norm (such as corruption, or bugs), they can be very useful.
REBUILD_CACHES=Rebuild caches
CACHES=Caches
ORPHANED_UPLOADS=Orphaned uploads
BROKEN_URLS=Broken URLs
BROKEN_URLS_FILES=(pointing to on-disk uploads)
BROKEN_URLS_404=(that returned 404 errors when retrieving)
ORPHANED_LANG_STRINGS=Language string corruption
MISSING_LANG_STRINGS=Language strings that were missing
FUSED_LANG_STRINGS=Language strings that were fused to multiple content items
ORPHANED_LANG_STRINGS=Language strings that were orphaned (unused)
DESCRIPTION_ORPHANED_LANG_STRINGS=The website software has advanced internationalisation support at its core: most content can be naturally translated into multiple languages. This support requires all language strings to be stored separately to actual content. This tool will detail and repair any problems in the link between content and language strings.
DESCRIPTION_ORPHANED_UPLOADS=The website software associates on-disk files (stored in the <kbd>uploads/</kbd> subdirectories) with content. This tool will list all the files the website software believes are on-disk, but not actually used. Please do not delete them without giving each individual consideration: it is possible that someone has manually placed them (or an unofficial addon has made them) and referenced them in a non-standard way.
DESCRIPTION_BROKEN_URLS=This tool is the opposite to the orphaned-uploads tool: it will find references to on-disk files for content where the files do not actually exist. The database records of the content will be detailed in a coded format, from which you can determine the resource type and the resource ID. This tool will also test non-local URLs for &lsquo;404&rsquo; errors.
LANGUAGE_CACHE=Language cache
DESCRIPTION_LANGUAGE_CACHE=The language cache caches strings for languages in a fast PHP-friendly format.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_lang_cache=Enable language cacheing. This will give a small performance improvement.
CLEANUP_TOOLS=Website cleanup tools
CACHES_PAGE=Choose what you would like to clean-up from the list. It is advised to only tick (check) the options you need &ndash; indiscriminately running all tools will not likely result in any net benefit, and will cause a temporary load-increase on your server.
CACHES_PAGE_CACHES=You may wish to rebuild caches after editing content outside the official website interfaces, or if cache files are lost or corrupt &ndash; however you should not ever need to rebuild caches if you have only been administering the website normally.<br /><br />If you regularly make manual changes to files outside website interfaces, you may find it useful to know that you can automatically regenerate any cache used in the generation of a page by clicking the web browser refresh button whilst holding the <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd> keys down together.
CACHES_PAGE_EXP_OPTIMISERS=Optimisers
CACHES_PAGE_EXP_CACHES=De-cachers
DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATES=Rebuild the templates cache (language, theme and site configuration information is compiled into the template cache).
IMAGE_THUMBNAILS=Image thumbnails
DESCRIPTION_IMAGE_THUMBNAILS=Rebuild all the thumbnails for your images. Do <strong>not</strong> use if you do not have the GD image library installed on your server.
COMCODE_CACHE=Comcode field pre-calculations
DESCRIPTION_COMCODE_CACHE=Comcode fields are cached in a pre-calculated format which is a cross between Comcode and <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. In theory this should mean that changes to site configuration shouldn't damage the validity, but some changes may do so.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_block_cache=Enable block cacheing. It is highly recommended that this option is left on for a production website, but whilst you are setting up a site you may wish to disable it so that your changes are reflected immediately.
THEME_IMAGES_CACHE=Theme images
DESCRIPTION_THEME_IMAGES_CACHE=Any mapping in the theme image mapping which is not a specially uploaded user-image. This will allow re-searching for URLs for theme images that have not been explicitly overridden in the image manager.
BLOCK_CACHE=Block cache
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_comcode_page_cache=Enable Comcode page cacheing. It is highly recommended this option is left on for a production website, but whilst you are setting up a site you may wish to disable it so you can directly edit Comcode pages as text files on the server (in theory the software can track when you change the file manually, but sometimes dates can get confused between desktop machines and servers).
COMCODE_PAGE_CACHE=Comcode page cache
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_template_cache=Enable template cacheing. If you are editing templates manually (without the aid of the website software) and do not want to manually empty the cache for every change, this option can be turned off (in theory the software can track when you change the file manually, but sometimes dates can get confused between desktop machines and servers).
TEMPLATE_CACHE=Template cache
DESCRIPTION_BLOCK_CACHE=Purge the block cacheing.
STATS_CACHE=Statistics cache
DESCRIPTION_STATS_CACHE=Certain statistics, such as total downloads and bandwidth usage are calculated on-the-fly, and/or regularly calculated. If these statistics have become inaccurate, you may wish to recalculate them.
MYSQL_OPTIMISE=Optimise/fix database tables
DESCRIPTION_MYSQL_OPTIMISE=This will tidy up your database tables to make your site run more smoothly.
TABLE_ERROR=Error found on table {1}&hellip; {2}={3}
TABLE_FIXED=When repairing table {1}&hellip; {2}={3}
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_cleanup=Website cleanup tools
CORRECT_MYSQL_SCHEMA_ISSUES=Correct MySQL schema issues
DESCRIPTION_CORRECT_MYSQL_SCHEMA_ISSUES=Programmers will often make changes to MySQL databases manually, but this disadvantages the software because properly written code will create additional structural meta-data in the database that is used to provide a rich cross-platform way to query the database (used by the backup system, as well as broken image checking, and various other features). This tool will identify missing schema data and fill in the blanks; it cannot identify exact types so will try and intelligently guess and show the results.
MYSQL_QUERY_CHANGES_MADE=The following query was executed to fix the database: <code>{1}</code>
NO_MYSQL_QUERY_CHANGES_MADE=No MySQL schema changes were required.
