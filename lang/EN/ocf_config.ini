FAX_NUMBER=Fax number

CONFIG_OPTION_privacy_fax=The fax address used as a point of contact for privacy matters (including COPPA consent forms).
CONFIG_OPTION_privacy_postal_address=The postal address used as a point of contact for privacy matters (including COPPA consent forms).
HTTPAUTH_IS_ENABLED=HTTP-Auth is enabled
CONFIG_OPTION_httpauth_is_enabled=Whether HTTP-Auth member synchronisation is enabled (if it is, the website software will automatically create and authenticate a bound account for all HTTP-Auth authenticated usernames).
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_LDAP=<abbr title="Lightweight Directory Access Protocol">LDAP</abbr> is an advanced feature and if you've never heard of it then don't worry about this setting group.
LDAP_IS_ENABLED=LDAP is enabled
LDAP_BASE_DN=LDAP base-DN
LDAP_HOSTNAME=LDAP hostname
LDAP_ALLOW_JOINING=Allow non-LDAP joining
INVITES_ENABLED=Invites enabled
INVITES_PER_DAY=Invites per-day
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_invites=Require members to be invited to your website before they can join it.
CONFIG_OPTION_invites_per_day=The number of invitations per day per user. You may enter a decimal number if you like.
CONFIG_OPTION_ldap_is_enabled=Whether LDAP integration is enabled (requires a properly configured LDAP server).
CONFIG_OPTION_ldap_base_dn=The base-DN of the LDAP server being used.
CONFIG_OPTION_ldap_hostname=The hostname or IP address of the LDAP server being used.
CONFIG_OPTION_ldap_allow_joining=Allow members to join; i.e. allow non-LDAP members.
CONFIG_OPTION_ldap_bind_rdn=Username (RDN) for binding to LDAP server (leave blank for anonymous bind). Please note that using the superuser account is a very bad idea, as the password gets stored in the database in plain-text; it is best to use a special read-only access account, or anonymous bind. Depending on your LDAP server, this should or should not be fully qualified (i.e. include the base-DN). On Active Directory it should definitely <strong>not</strong> be fully qualified, as that will break SAM logins.
CONFIG_OPTION_ldap_bind_password=Password for binding to LDAP server (leave blank for anonymous bind).
CONFIG_OPTION_ldap_is_windows=Whether the LDAP server is a Windows Active Directory server.
LDAP_GROUP_SEARCH_QUALIFIER=Group search qualifier
LDAP_MEMBER_SEARCH_QUALIFIER=Member search qualifier
LDAP_MEMBER_PROPERTY=Login property
CONFIG_OPTION_ldap_group_search_qualifier=Advanced. Where in the LDAP hierarchy to search for groups. On Active Directory, this is usually 'cn=Builtin', otherwise it is often 'ou=Groups'. May be left blank (searches everywhere, based on object class).
CONFIG_OPTION_ldap_member_search_qualifier=Advanced. Where in the LDAP hierarchy to search for members. On Active Directory, this is usually 'cn=Users', otherwise it is often 'ou=Users'. May be left blank (searches everywhere, based on object class).
CONFIG_OPTION_ldap_member_property=The property in LDAP used for logins. On Active Directory this is 'sAMAccountName', and on most Linux boxes it is 'uid' &ndash; but conceivably on some box 'cn' could work ('cn' is always there but often used for 'Full name' rather than the login name). Be aware that your choice of property isn't a true 'choice' (unless you check/tick the 'Manual authentication checks' option), what you specify must be in LDAP and must be what LDAP allows for its login ('bind') operations.
LDAP_GROUP_CLASS=Group class
CONFIG_OPTION_ldap_group_class=The LDAP object class used to hold usergroups. On Active Directory, this is 'group'.
LDAP_MEMBER_CLASS=Member class
CONFIG_OPTION_ldap_member_class=The LDAP object class used to hold users. On Active Directory, this is 'user'.
LDAP_VERSION=LDAP version
CONFIG_OPTION_ldap_version=The LDAP version number to use. Recent installs will likely be 3, older ones will likely be 2. It is important to get this right or you will get a "protocol error". Active Directory is always version 3.
LDAP_NONE_BIND_LOGINS=Manual authentication checks
CONFIG_OPTION_ldap_none_bind_logins=Advanced. Whether to check authentication via a password hash compare, as opposed to attempting an LDAP bind using the credentials. Doing a manual check divorces you from relying on LDAP to handle logins the way you want them, but also means you need LDAP to export password hashes in a standard format (Active Directory usually cannot).

WINDOWS_AUTHENTICATION=Integrated windows kerberos authentication.
CONFIG_OPTION_windows_auth_is_enabled=Enable/Disable Integrated Windows Kerberos Authentication for automatic desktop client logins.

ONE_PER_EMAIL_ADDRESS=Restrict to one member per e-mail address

CONFIG_OPTION_no_dob_ask=Whether to include the date-of-birth field for member accounts. It may be inappropriate to ask for a date of birth, or it may be vital for your market research, or you may want to provide a choice so that birthdays on your community may be celebrated.

CONFIG_OPTION_random_avatars=Assign random avatars to new members. Avatars are chosen from the default set, so put any avatars you want people to be randomly given as theme images in this set.

CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_invisibility=Whether to allow members to login as invisible.
