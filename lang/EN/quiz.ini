IMPORT_QUESTIONS_TEXT=The text should consist of question blocks, each question block having a blank line between it and the next. The first line of a question block is the question, and subsequent lines are a set of potential answers.<br /><br />There are a few different types of question, indicated by a little tag after the question:<ul><li><kbd>[MULTIPLECHOICE]</kbd> &ndash; The user can pick any one answer from the answer set</li><li><kbd>[MULTIMULTIPLE]</kbd> &ndash; The user can pick multiple answers from the answer set</li><li><kbd>[LONG]</kbd> &ndash; A multi-line typed answer (the answer set will be ignored)</li><li><kbd>[SHORT]</kbd> &ndash; A single-line typed answer (if answers are provided then a case-insensitive punctuationless substring match will be performed -- the user needs to hit a valid answer, and miss all invalid answers)</li></ul>If a question is followed by <kbd>[REQUIRED]</kbd> then the software will force it to be filled in (unless you have set a timeout and the timeout is exceeded).<br /><br />There is support for marking. If an answer is followed by <kbd>[*]</kbd> then it is considered &lsquo;correct&rsquo; (this is very important for competitions and tests); if nothing is marked correct, the question will be considered as manually-marked (resulting in a quoted result range for the user, rather than a specific result), unless <kbd>[UNMARKED]</kbd> is put after the question, in which case it will be collected but not count towards marking.<br /><br />You may put line(s) starting with a &lsquo;:&rsquo; and followed by an explanation, below each answer to a question, which will be displayed at completion for the explanation as to specifically why the given answer was correct or incorrect.You may also put line(s) starting with a &lsquo;:&rsquo; immediately under the question, to provide a longer caption for the question.
