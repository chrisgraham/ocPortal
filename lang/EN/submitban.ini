[strings]
CHOOSE_MEMBER=Choose member
CHOOSE_ACTION=Choose action
VIEW_ACTION_LOGS=Action logs (audit trail)
DOC_ACTION_LOG=The action log will allow you to trace what actions have been performed on the site; and where given, the reasons for doing them. This log gives a combined view of submission, administration, and moderation actions, and provides integration with the tracing and IP banning modules, as well as submitter banning of its own.
DOC_IPBAN=Banning IP addresses is useful to totally remove a user's ability to access the site; unfortunately, users can very easily switch IP addresses. More information about IP addresses is given in the "IP addresses and tracking users" tutorial.
BANNED_ADDRESSES=Banned IP addresses
EXTERNALLY_BANNED_ADDRESSES=Externally banned addresses (will timeout according to &ldquo;Block list cache time&rdquo; setting)
DESCRIPTION_BANNED_ADDRESSES_A=You may ban IP addresses from accessing this website using this tool.
DESCRIPTION_BANNED_ADDRESSES_B=Each line of the text box below indicates an IP address that should be banned. Wildcards may be used. You may enter a note to the right of each address if you wish.
SPAM_AUTO_BAN_TIMEOUT={1} {2} - until {3}
IP_BANNING_WILDCARDS=IP address bans restrict access to the website on a low level. Be careful to [url="know an IP address"]{1}[/url] before you ban it to avoid inadvertently banning a shared computer/Internet-gateway. Please also be advised that [abbr="Internet Service Provider"]ISP[/abbr]-assigned addresses are often not fixed: a computer's IP address might vary substantially from one day to the next.\n\nAddresses may contain &lsquo;wildcards&rsquo; (asterisks) between dotted segments to symbolise that any number in that segment will match.\n\nIt is usual to have an asterisk as the final (fourth) part, as a user's IP address is very likely to change in that final component and at the same time it is very unlikely that wildcarding that last portion would result in any unintended bans. This said, extreme care is advised using wildcards at other points.

IP_LIST=This member has used the following IP addresses:
RELATED_SCREENS=Related screens
MEMBERS_ALSO_ON_IP=The following additional members were also found to have used this IP address: {1}. It may be the address of a shared computer, or gateway, or it may be that the member's are one-and-the-same &ndash; further investigation of the member's history may reveal a clearer picture and help you decide what to do (e.g. warnings, member-merging).
DOC_ACTIONLOG_BAN_HELP=This screen to find information relating to a website user. It's purpose is as a hub for information, and does not provide any information that is not also available elsewhere in the software. The primary screen for managing a joined member is the member's profile screen.\n\nThe software has tried to pull together as much as it can, by trying to match against the triad of [b]IP address[/b], [b]member ID[/b], and [b]username[/b]/[b]author[/b]. Links are provided that correspond to each of these, each link providing a different perspective on what is likely a single user.\n\nIf you would like to ban the member, it is advised that this be done through their member profile. If you would like to provide a more low-level ban against IP address, note down their IP address groups and then proceed to the [url="IP ban"]{1}[/url] screen. Before proceeding though, it is advisable to carefully research the usages of each IP address set by performing additional IP-based lookups (following the IP addresses as linked will lead you to the appropriate screens).
