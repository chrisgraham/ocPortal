DOC_CEDI=Wiki+ is a hierarchical database of pages and posts which is in many ways like a forum system, but presented in an encyclopaedic style, and designed to have a deep and extensible hierarchy. Wiki+ can also be configured to behave just like a wiki system, by linking pages purely by using hypertext links. It is a collaborative, community-driven tool for the organisation of media and information; unlike wikis it is capable of providing a well-organised structure, with flexible permissions to allow the staff complete control over how open the system will be.\n\nInformation is presented using [concept]Comcode[/concept] and the Comcode attachment system, meaning there is excellent support for rich media. Wiki+ is ideal for storing collaboratively/interactively extended information with a high organisational factor; the speed of which information can be added is also particularly advantageous. This pattern works very well for types of ad-hoc guide, especially community-driven ones.
