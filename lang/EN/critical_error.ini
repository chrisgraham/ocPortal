JAVASCRIPT_ERROR=An error occurred when loading this screen onto the web browser. You are being notified of this as you are staff. If you believe this is a bug in the website software, please contact ocProducts with full details. More details are available in your browser's error console. The error was:
CORRUPT_TAR=This TAR file is corrupt

HTTP_REDIRECT_PROBLEM_WITHWWW=A problem has been detected with your web server that may cause your login to fail &ndash; if it does, click back and read the rest of this message. Some servers are poorly configured, and invisibly redirect traffic from one URL to another, and this invisible redirection results in lost submitted form data. Try changing your base URL in the <a target="_blank" href="{1}">config editor</a> so that it doesn't contain <kbd>www.</kbd> then come back to this URL (make sure to refresh the page) and try again. If problems persist, contact your web host. This autodetection will not be done once you have opened your website.
HTTP_REDIRECT_PROBLEM_WITHOUTWWW=A problem has been detected with your web server that may cause your login to fail &ndash; if it does, click back and read the rest of this message. Some servers are poorly configured, and invisibly redirect traffic from one URL to another, and this invisible redirection results in lost submitted form data. Try changing your base URL in the <a target="_blank" href="{1}">config editor</a> so that it contains <kbd>www.</kbd> then come back to this URL (make sure to refresh the page) and try again. If problems persist, contact your web host. This autodetection will not be done once you have opened your website.

AUTO_BAN_DOS_MESSAGE=An IP address, {1}, has been automatically banned for generating {2} flood warnings in {3} seconds. If you believe that the user was manipulated into triggering the alerts, you may wish to consider unbanning this IP address. Be advised that the website software has essentially prevented what could be a 'DOS' (Denial Of Service) attack which could over-load the server if left to continue; it may have been triggered by innocent infected computers, or other form of computer manipulation. This said, this may just be an innocent computer that accidently or for good reason, using up a high server load.

HACK_ATTACK_INFO=A potential hacking attempt has been detected. Please do not be alarmed: approximately half of the suspected attempts are triggered innocently (the software intentionally has a paranoid security model, to give you very high security). Real hacking attempts are almost always caused by 'bots' (computer programs) that automatically crawl the internet looking for websites which may contain vulnerabilities, and then reporting any found vulnerabilities to their 'master' for future exploitation (usually, to assist in spam relaying). If this was a real hack attempt, it has failed - you might want to try and analyse the logged details (in case it gives clues to a real and persistent offender). More information on security is given in the software documentation.
ERROR_MAIL=An error occurred at:\n[url="{1}"]{1}[/url]\n\nThe full error details follow:\n\n[html]{2}[/html]
REFERRER=(Referrer is: {1}, User agent is: {2})
LANGUAGE_CORRUPTION=Language corruption detected and fixed (when looking up language string #{1}). This means that a database inconsistency had developed, but has fixed itself.
SHOULD_HAVE_BEEN_POSTED=You have gone to an URL which requires &lsquo;posted&rsquo; data to be sent (<kbd>{1}</kbd>), as well as the information in the URL itself. This is most likely because you have copied and pasted a link to a new browser window, but the page the link was for was a results page for an action.
SHOULD_HAVE_BEEN_POSTED_FILE_ERROR=It appears that you have made a file upload but exceeded this servers &lsquo;post_max_size&rsquo; limit ({2}) or &lsquo;upload_max_filesize&rsquo; limit ({3}). Unfortunately this renders your form submission invisible to the software. Please try again with a smaller size, or get the <kbd>post_max_size</kbd> limit increased. An alternate explanation is if you reached this URL manually &ndash; this URL is intended solely for processing the result of a form submitted to it, and the <var>{1}</var> parameter is missing.
WRITE_ERROR=Cannot write to <kbd>{1}</kbd>. File permissions for it (or the directory it is in) have not been set correctly.
READ_ERROR=Cannot read the <kbd>{1}</kbd> file. It is probably missing.
WRITE_ERROR_DIRECTORY_REPAIR=Cannot create a directory <kbd>{1}</kbd>. This file should have existed anyway, but we tried to repair it and failed. Please create this directory manually and apply full write permissions.
WRITE_ERROR_DIRECTORY=Cannot create a directory <kbd>{1}</kbd>. Please apply full write permissions to the parent directory (<kbd>{2}</kbd>).
WRITE_ERROR_MISSING_DIRECTORY=An expected directory, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, is missing.

NO_DIRECTIVE_TYPE=No directive type specified in <kbd>{1}</kbd> on line {2}
ABRUPTED_DIRECTIVE_OR_BRACE=Abrupted brace or directive in template <kbd>{1}</kbd> on line {2}

UNMATCHED_DIRECTIVE=Unmatched directive in template <kbd>{1}</kbd>
COMPLEX_FIRST_PARAMETER=You aren't allowed to build up variable names dynamically via nesting, they should be alphanumeric strings with optional trailing escaping characters.
ATTACHMENT_WOULD_NOT_UPLOAD=The attachment would not upload. Perhaps there was a connection problem, or the file was larger than the allowed attachment size ({1} MB for files, {2} MB for images).
MISSING_MENU=Missing menu (<kbd>{1}</kbd>). You may <a href="{2}">add it</a>.
STACK_TRACE_INFORMATION=Below is a stack trace revealing the state the software was in when the error occurred. If this represents a bug in the unmodified software, you may want to check {1} website for a fix, and if there isn't one, report this as a bug. Please note that merely posting a stack trace is not sufficient for us to solve your problem; the stack trace is just an aid that presents us with additional information. We still need to know the error message, what you tried to do, how you tried to do it, version numbers, and any other appropriate information.<br />We apologise for this problem and if it's a bug we hope you will work with us so that we can fix it for you promptly.

MUST_DELETE_INSTALLER=You must delete the <kbd>install.php</kbd> file immediately, or your installation is open to erasure by anyone; if you installed via the ocProducts copy-to-hosting feature then you will be able to see and delete this file if you open up FTP manually
ERROR_OCCURRED=An error has occurred
ERROR_OCCURRED_SUBJECT=An error occurred on the '{1}' page
SOME_ERRORS_OCCURRED=Some errors occurred during the action

CONNECT_DB_ERROR=Could not connect to the database
NO_PARAMETER_SENT=A critical parameter, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, was missing.
NO_PARAMETER_SENT_SPECIAL=A critical parameter, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, was missing. This error usually happens when the website engine has been installed with an incorrect base-URL (such as http://example.com/ instead of http://www.example.com/). Some server configurations allow multiple domain names as illustrated, but perform automated redirections which result in parameter loss. Use config_editor.php to fix your base-URL.

NO_FORUM_INSTALLED=You must have a forum to perform this action
NO_MEMBER_SYSTEM_INSTALLED=You must have a member system to perform this action
MANY_QUERIES=This page has used at least {1} queries. This is a very excessive query count and deserves attention.
MISSING_CONFIRM_CODE=A confirmation code was not given in the URL. You may type it here manually to perform this action (along with any other required details). You will find the confirmation code in the e-mail you have received.
MISSING_FORUM=Missing forum: {1}
MSG_JS_NEEDED=Javascript support is needed in your web browser to do this. If you are visiting this page by a direct link, try refreshing, as we need one page reload to detect if Javascript is present. If you have Javascript (or cookies) disabled in your web browser, you may wish to enable them to view this page; few pages on this site require them &ndash; and there are always alternatives &ndash; but interface usability is greatly enhanced when they are enabled. If you do not have Javascript in your browser because you have a disability, you should be able to still achieve what you need through other site features: if this is not the case, please contact the site staff.
MERGE_SAME=Both given are the same, therefore cannot merge.
ZONE_NOT_INSTALLED=You are visiting a zone which has not been installed. The staff must install it before it may be used.
BAD_ZONE=You are accessing a directory through the software (<kbd>{1}</kbd>) which is not a zone. It is not configured as a zone in the software and does not have a &lsquo;pages&rsquo; directory.
CAPTCHA_NO_SESSION=The session for the confirming the security image has expired, or never existed. Please start the process again from the start, and if it persists, report this problem, and details of your internet connection type.
ALREADY_BEEN_DONE=This has already been done. There is no need to re-do it.

LOW_DISK_SPACE_MAIL=The server is critically low on disk space, with only {1}MB remaining. Check with your web host or remove some of your files to fix this problem.
COULD_NOT_SAVE_FILE=Could not save. Are you out of disk space or quota space? Did you try and use a file that was 0 bytes?
COULD_NOT_SAVE_FILE_TMP=Could not save. Are you out of disk space or quota space? The file failed to save in a temporary directory, {1}, so it could be this directory that is out of quota space.
SHARED_INSTALL_PROHIBIT=You are using a shared install, which renders this action prohibited.
NOTHING_SELECTED=Nothing was selected/chosen, so no operation could be performed.
NOTHING_SELECTED_YET=Nothing was selected/chosen, so no operation can yet be performed.
SD_WARNING_BELOW=If you believe this suspected hack attempt is neither correct nor benign, but rather actually represents a substantial stability problem in the website software, read the information below. Otherwise, do not read on.
NO_SUCH_CONTENT_TYPE=There is no content-type, &lsquo;{1}&rsquo;. For a list of valid content-types see the filenames <kbd>sources/hooks/systems/awards</kbd> folder (e.g. presence of <kbd>example.php</kbd> implies <kbd>example</kbd> is a content-type).
LEECH_BLOCK=This request has been blocked because it is a suspected leeching attempt. If you are accessing this entry via the official source (and you haven't bookmarked it, for example), please contact the site staff.
FXML_FIELD_TOO_SHORT=The field, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, should be at least {2} {2|character|characters} in length.
FXML_FIELD_PATTERN_FAIL=The field, <kbd>{1}</kbd> did not match the required pattern <kbd>{2}</kbd>.

FXML_FIELD_SHUNNED=The specified field value for the field, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, is disallowed.
FXML_FIELD_SHUNNED_SUBSTRING=The specified field value for the field, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, contains a disallowed substring, &ldquo;{2}&rdquo;.
FXML_FIELD_NOT_IN_SET=The specified field value for the field, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, does not match one of the allowed values ({2}).
FXML_FIELD_NOT_IN_SET_SECRETIVE=The specified field value for the field, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, does not match one of the allowed values.
MYSQL_ONLY=Unfortunately this functionality currently only works with mySQL as the database.
XML_NEEDED=The PHP XML extension on your server is needed to use this feature.
GD_NEEDED=The PHP GD extension on your server is needed to use this feature.
FTP_NEEDED=The PHP FTP extension on your server is needed to use this feature.
BAD_ACCESS_DOMAIN=You are accessing via <kbd>{2}</kbd>, but the domain in the base URL is <kbd>{1}</kbd>. Accessing from the wrong domain will cause <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr> problems, and Javascript security errors. You might want to set up a redirect on your web server to guarantee visitors reach the correct domain.
COOKIE_CONFLICT_DELETE_COOKIES=You have conflicting cookies on your computer. The website can not set cookies as others are stuck in place. Please delete all cookies for this website in your web browser.
BROKEN_XHTML_FIXED=<p class="red_alert" role="error">This code may have contained invalid XHTML. Some display changes were made to avoid crashing this editor.</p>
COOKIE_CONFLICT_DELETE_COOKIES=You have conflicting cookies on your computer. The website can not set cookies as others are stuck in place. Please delete all cookies for this website in your web browser.
NULL_LANG_STRING=The software has been asked to look-up a language string, NULL. This should not happen and represents a bug.
NO_DELETE_LAST_CATEGORY=You cannot delete the only remaining category &ndash; there must always be at least one. You may, however, edit this category to make it meet your needs.
STOPPED_RECURSIVE_RESOURCE_INCLUDE=There seemed to have been a loop of resource includes (e.g. a resource, such as a page, includes itself). The loop has been stopped so the server does not crash.
NOT_IN_PREVIEW_MODE=You are previewing, so button clicks have been disabled.
IMAGE_TOO_LARGE_FOR_THUMB=Sorry, the image is too large (in terms of width and height) for us to generate a thumbnail on the website server. We can handle an image of approximately {1}&times;{2} pixels.
PLEASE_REVIEW_ERRORS_AT_BOTTOM=There was an error during output. You are in debug/development mode, meaning that you will probably see an XHTML error in your browser when you click the Okay button. Review what errors are shown at the end of the page before clicking Okay.
WARN_TO_STACK_TRACE=You have permission to <a href="{1}">see a stack trace for this condition</a>. This error message may not indicate a system fault, which is why the stack trace was not shown automatically; however if it is a fault, stack traces help programmers identify the cause of a problem and thus are great for bug reports.
WARN_TO_STACK_TRACE_2=You have permission to <form class="inline" method="post" action="{1}">{2}<div class="inline"><input type="submit" class="button_hyperlink" value="see a stack trace of this error" /></div></form>. Stack traces help programmers identify the cause of a problem so are good for making bug reports. As the page is POSTed clicking the link will resubmit the form.
WARN_TO_STACK_TRACE_3=You have permission to <a href="{1}">see a stack trace of this error</a>. Stack traces help programmers identify the cause of a problem so are good for making bug reports. Unfortunately you uploaded some files which we can't resend automatically, so the link will take you back to the front page, but if you then go forward to repeat the action you will see a stack trace instead.
LOW_SUHOSIN_SETTING=Your server has a <kbd>suhosin.post.max_vars</kbd> setting which is below 400. Suhosin is an unofficial PHP extension many web hosts use to add security, but this option will break parts of the software by limiting the number of form fields it can use. Our <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> contains a suggested remedy.
NO_PHP_IN_TEMPLATES=The hidden <kbd>allow_php_in_templates</kbd> option is not turned on, so PHP code in templates will not run. The option is described in the ocPortal Code Book, available from ocportal.com. The standard practice for your use case is to create and reference a miniblock, as it separates concerns well, promotes re-usability, and provides a security barrier.
HTACCESS_SEO_PROBLEM=It looks like you have enabled &ldquo;New Style Short URLs&rdquo; and added a custom zone, but may not have edited your <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file to refer to the new zone by extending the default rewrite-rules.
NO_INTEGERS_TEMPLATE=Programming error: Integers and/or floats should not be passed into templates (<var>{1}</var>): convert them to strings via <kbd>integer_format</kbd>/<kbd>float_format</kbd>/<kbd>strval</kbd>.
NO_HIPHOP=This feature does not work on alternative PHP implementations.
TOO_MANY_USERS_ONLINE=There are too many online users to list.
CANNOT_WILDCARD_START=There are too many users to search like this, please put your wildcard further in the query.
TOO_MUCH_CHOOSE__TOP_ONLY=There are too many choices to display, so we have shown the most significant {1} {1|one|ones} here.
TOO_MUCH_CHOOSE__RECENT_ONLY=There are too many choices to display, so we have shown the most recent {1} {1|one|ones} here. You can access edit screens from the main website screens (which have paginated results) or the search module.
TOO_MUCH_CHOOSE__ALPHABETICAL=There are too many choices to display, so we have shown the first {1} {1|one|ones} here (alphabetically). You can access edit screens from the main website screens (which have paginated results) or the search module.
TOO_MUCH_CHOOSE__UNKNOWN=There are too many choices to display, so we have shown just {1} {1|one|ones} here.
