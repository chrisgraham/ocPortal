[strings]
DOC_COMCODE_PAGE_EDIT=Use Comcode pages to build your own website pages, independently of any predefined structure.
DOC_PAGE_WIZARD=The add-new-page wizard helps you to add new pages to your site without having to use the full Site Tree interface and then manually add them to menus. It is designed to help beginners quickly build up a site with a number of custom pages.
NO_JS_ADVANCED_SCREEN_SITE_TREE=Unfortunately you do not have Javascript support enabled in your web browser, which means this advanced editor can not function. You are now being redirected to a a screen where you can choose from a number of more primitive editing screens.
NO_JS_ADVANCED_SCREEN_ZONE_EDITOR=Unfortunately you do not have Javascript support enabled in your web browser, which means this advanced editor can not function. You are now being redirected to a a screen where you can use the more basic (but not limiting) zone management forms.
DOC_ZONES=Zones are the software's method for supporting sub-sites. The website directory structure could be heavily simplified from the user's point of view, to be as follows:\n - (root directory)\n  - adminzone\n  - docs\n  - forum\n  - cms\n  - site\n  - personalzone\n  - collaboration\nEach entry in this list, including the root directory, is a 'zone'. A zone groups pages into URL-segregated directories, and can be individually configured. New zones may be added, existing zones deleted, and pages created in and moved between zones.
DOC_ZONE_EDITOR=The [concept]zone editor[/concept] is a user-friendly editor to edit details for a zone, and all panels within the zone, simultaneously. It has the ability to preview changes easily, without having to switch between the Admin Zone and the zone being edited.\n\nThe Zone Editor makes use of special tabs to fit everything together, with each panel/page getting its own tab-set. The tabs provided are: view, edit, details, and settings (except for the panels).
DOC_SITE_TREE_EDITOR=The [concept]Site Tree editor[/concept] allows you to see a complete view of all structure and content on the website. It provides features to manipulate the structure and content.
DOC_PAGES=Users with Javascript enabled have access to the Site Tree editor. Because you do not have Javascript enabled (or you manually accessed this entry-point), you are using the legacy page manipulation tools.
DELETE_BY_EMPTYING=If you wish this panel to not show, you may simply leave its Comcode blank.
DESCRIPTION_OLD_COMCODE_PAGE=Select an existing Comcode page, or choose &lsquo;N/A&rsquo; if you wish to create a new one below.
DESCRIPTION_NEW_COMCODE_PAGE=If you wish to create a new page, input a name for it in the format <kbd>zone:file</kbd> (e.g. <kbd>adminzone:adminguide</kbd> or <kbd>:userguide</kbd>).
CLONE=Clone
PAGE_TYPE=Current page type
ZE_CLICK_TO_EDIT=(click to save changes to all settings and panels above)
SITE_TREE_EDITOR=Site Tree editor
REDIRECT_PAGE_TO=Redirection to <kbd>{1}:{2}</kbd>
MINIMODULE=Mini-module
ZONE_EDITOR=Block/panel layout (Zone Editor)
_ZONE_EDITOR=Zone Editor: {1} zone
HEADER_TEXT_ADMINZONE=Admin Zone
HEADER_TEXT_collaboration=Collaboration Zone
DESCRIPTION_ZONE_RENAME=You may rename this zone, but be aware that doing so will break any hard-coded links to pages within it. If the links have been constructed to point to the <kbd>_SEARCH</kbd> zone, then this should not be a problem.
DESCRIPTION_ZONE_RENAME_DEFAULT_ZONE=<strong>It is best to not rename this default zone: renaming it will make it much harder to perform upgrades</strong>. Also be aware that renaming this zone will break any hard-coded links to pages within it. If the links have been constructed to point to the <kbd>_SEARCH</kbd> zone, then this should not be a problem.
ADD_ZONE=Add zone
EDIT_ZONE=Edit zone
ZONE=Zone
DEFAULT_PAGE=Default page
DESCRIPTION_DEFAULT_PAGE=The page opened if none is specified in the URL.
HEADER_TEXT=Header text
DESCRIPTION_HEADER_TEXT=The text appended to all page titles (e.g. a slogan).
_DESCRIPTION_THEME=Change the theme used by selecting from a list of installed themes. If you choose &lsquo;Respect member settings&rsquo;, then the theme will be decided according to the member's forum skin selection (or the forum default), using a complex (but flexible) mapping scheme. For sites which don't try and integrate the forums and main-website together, and don't want to give users a theme choice, a hard-coded choice here is best.<br />Note that this option will not be respected if the viewing member does not have access to view this theme (by default any new theme does have full access though) &ndash; in this circumstance the default theme would be used.
_DESCRIPTION_THEME_OCF=Change the theme used by selecting from a list of installed themes. If you choose &lsquo;Respect member settings&rsquo;, then the theme will be decided according to the member's theme selection (in their member profile settings) &ndash; or if they have not chosen one (e.g. if there is only one available to them, or if they are a guest) the theme with the name &ldquo;{1}&rdquo;, or if that does not exist the &ldquo;default&ldquo; theme.<br />Note that this option will not be respected if the viewing member does not have access to view this theme (by default any new theme does have full access though) &ndash; in this circumstance the default theme would be used.
WIDE=Opt to hide the left/right navigation
DESCRIPTION_WIDE=If you opt to hide the left/right navigation, some sections of the site will not display it when it's not needed and it might get in the way.
REQUIRE_SESSION=Require confirmed session
DESCRIPTION_REQUIRE_SESSION=If a zone contains very sensitive powers, it is wise to require a confirmed session to enter the zone. This forces a user to explicitly re-login to enter the zone (i.e. a remembered login isn't good enough), and thus malicious pages on other websites cannot automatically direct proxy actions to the zone due to this barrier (<abbr title="Cross Site Request Forgery">CSRF</abbr> vulnerabilities). Note that this option is not for defining access levels (use normal permissions for that), although it does block guest access as a side-effect.
ZONE_ADD_TEXT=As well as the configuration for a zone that may be set on this page, you also need a file-system structure. This will be created for you automatically.
DELETE_ZONE=Delete zone
DELETE_ZONE_ERROR=You can't delete a zone if it contains any pages (except standard pages: panels and the 'start' page). The zone contains the following pages that you'll need to move or delete first&hellip;<br />{1}
DESCRIPTION_DESTINATION_ZONE=The zone to which the pages will be moved.
SELECT_PAGES_DELETE=Select the pages which you would like to delete. You will not be given any further confirmation, so make sure you are very careful and have suitable backups! <strong>it is not recommended that you delete modules, as this will make upgrading difficult</strong> &ndash; instead use page permissions, or uninstall addons.
SELECT_PAGES_MOVE=Select the pages which you would like to move to another zone, and the destination zone to which to move them. Please note that <strong>it is not recommended that you move modules, as this will make upgrading difficult</strong> &ndash; make page redirects instead.
DELETE_PAGES=Delete pages
MOVE_PAGES=Move pages
EXPORT_COMCODE_PAGE=Export Comcode page
EXPORT_COMCODE_PAGE_TEXT=You may copy and paste the following Comcode elsewhere, and all attachments on the page will be copied with it:

COMCODE_PAGE_OWN_EDIT=Edit own Comcode page
COMCODE_PAGE_ADD=Add Comcode page

COMCODE_PAGES=Comcode pages
COMCODE_PAGE=Comcode page
ORIGINAL_PAGE_NO_RENAME=The operation was completed successfully. However, you renamed a default page, which is only partially possible &ndash; the original version of the page will remain with its original page name, and any modifications you have made have been saved under the page name you specified. If you do not want the original page to be accessible, consider using page permissions to deny access.
DESCRIPTION_COMCODE_PAGE_CACHE=Rebuild the Comcode page cache; do this if you have added or modified Comcode pages manually (i.e. without using the software's interface).
ZONE_COLON_FILE=You must input the name of a new page as in the format <kbd>zone:file</kbd> (e.g. <kbd>adminzone:adminguide</kbd> or <kbd>:userguide</kbd>)
PAGE_WIZARD=Add-New-Page Wizard
NO_ENTRY_POINT_SELECTED=Select a page-link from the Site Tree (by clicking on its text) to see information and options relating to it.
PAGE_DRAG=You may drag most page nodes to new zone nodes in order to move the page. When you do this, a window will popup and you will need to put in details to save the action. Please note that <strong>it is not recommended that you move modules, as this will make upgrading difficult</strong> &ndash; make <a href="{1}">page redirects</a> instead.
PAGE_LINK=Page link
MENU_TO_ADD_TO=Choose a menu into which you would like to add a link to your page, or N/A. The default choice is based on the zone you chose; as you gain more experience you will learn what these menu codes mean and you'll be able to fully edit, rearrange and create menus as needed.
PAGE_WIZARD_STEP=Add-New-Page Wizard, step&nbsp;{1}&nbsp;of&nbsp;{2}
DESCRIPTION_MENU_TITLE=The title to give the page on the menu (if you are not adding to a menu, it is still a good idea to put it in as it also sets the default title for the page itself).
MENU_ZONE=The zone to add this page to. Zones are like subdirectories of your website, with each zone having its own collection of pages. If unsure, you probably want the default selection (the site zone, or the welcome zone if you've enabled the &ldquo;Single public zone&rdquo; option), as that is the zone of your main website.
DESCRIPTION_PAGE_NAME=The name of your page. Page names become a part of the URL, and hence a short descriptive code (such as <kbd>mypage</kbd>) should be used, rather than a title (such as <kbd>My Page</kbd>). The use of spaces in the code is not advised.
PAGE_DEFAULT_TEXT=This page is under construction.\n[img]{$IMG,under_construction_animated}[/img]
PAGE_DEFAULT_TITLE=Title goes here
PARENT_PAGE=Parent page
DESCRIPTION_PARENT_PAGE=The page of this website that will be shown as the parent of this page in the &lsquo;breadcrumb trail&rsquo; (shown to the right of the page title). If you do not want to choose a parent page, choose &lsquo;N/A&rsquo;.
DISPLAYED_IN_MENU=Displayed in menu
DESCRIPTION_DISPLAYED_IN_MENU=Whether the zone is displayed in the zone menu (which is available in many themes, including the <kbd>default</kbd> theme).
ZONE_WRITE=<kbd>{1}:{2}</kbd>
PAGE_WRITE=<kbd>{1}</kbd>
SUGGEST_PAGE_WIZARD=If you wish to add a new page, you may wish to use the <a href="{1}">Add New Page Wizard</a> instead. This wizard will allow you to easily add your page to a menu after creating your page. If you wish to manipulate site structure, use the <a href="{2}">Site Tree Editor</a>.
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_zones=Zones
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_sitetree=Site structure
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_cms_comcode_pages=Comcode pages
SELECTION_DETAILS=Selection details
YOUR_NEW_ZONE=Your new zone
YOUR_NEW_ZONE_PAGE=Welcome to your new zone. You can now start setting up your menu, customising your panels, and writing this front page ([tt]{1}[/tt]).
ADMINZONE_SEARCH_RESULTS=You've just performed an Admin Zone search for <strong>{1}</strong>.<br />Do you also wish to run a separate search on your <a rel="search" href="{2}">website content</a> or in the <a rel="search" href="{3}" target="_blank" title="software's documentation: (this link will open in a new window)">software's documentation</a> or <a rel="search" href="{4}" target="_blank" title="software's forum: (this link will open in a new window)">software's forum</a>?<br /><br />The following results were found&hellip;
MODULES=Modules
ACTION_SCREENS=Action screens
USERGROUP_SETTINGS=Usergroup settings (available when adding/editing usergroups)
MEMBER_SETTINGS=Member settings (available when adding/editing members)
ZONE_OPTIONS=Zone options (available when adding/editing zones)
ADMINZONE_SEARCH_TIP=<br /><strong>Tips:</strong><ul><li>Use double quotes (&quot;) around phrases if you want to get exact matches on them.</li><li>You could search just one type of results by running a query such as &ldquo;{1} @conf&rdquo; (which matches anything under &ldquo;Configuration&rdquo; because &lsquo;conf&rsquo; is a substring of &ldquo;Configuration&rdquo;).</li><li>You can quickly search your website or the software website using OpenSearch which most web browsers have inbuilt support for. In Google chrome type the domain name into the search bar then space. In Firefox or Internet Explorer you will see your website advertised as an addable search item in the browser's separate search box.</li></ul>
BLOCKING_REDIRECT_IN_PLACE=There is a <a href="{1}">page redirect</a> that will prevent viewing of this page.
ADMIN_ZONE_SEARCH_RESULTS=Admin Zone Search Results
NO_LEVEL_1_HEADERS=You have not defined any level 1 headings, which will impinge on your <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr>, breadcrumbs, and web accessibility. You can easily make one in the <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor (write some text, and select &lsquo;Heading 1&rsquo; from the format dropdown list), or via the Comcode 'title' tag. Advanced users can hide visually-undesired titles using <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
NO_LEVEL_2_HEADERS=You have not defined any level 2 headings, but you seem to have simulated them using custom styling, which will impinge on your web accessibility. You can easily make them in the <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor (select &lsquo;Heading 2&rsquo; from the format dropdown list), or with Comcode like <kbd>[title="2"]...[/title]</kbd>.
MENU_FULL_DETAILS={2}, in {3} zone [Codename: {1}]
HTM_SHORT_URLS_CARE=You are using the advanced &ldquo;Use new style short URLs&rdquo; option, which means you will need to change your <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file after adding a new zone so that redirect rules match it.
THEME_LOGO=Logo for &ldquo;{1}&rdquo; theme
FROM_ADDON=From addon '{1}', described as: {2}
EDIT_IN_FULL_PAGE_EDITOR=Edit in full page editor

ZE_HOW_TO_SAVE=Scroll to bottom and click button to save.
MENUS_EXISTING_USED=Existing used menus
MENUS_EXISTING_UNUSED=Existing unused menus
MENUS_NEW=Empty used menus
