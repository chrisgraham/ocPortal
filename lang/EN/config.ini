[strings]
MOD_SECURITY=You appear to have ModSecurity (or a similar web application firewall) that is blocking some legitimate software requests with a status code of '{1}'. It is vital you get your web host to disable this as otherwise you will not be able to administer your website. Web application firewalls are legitimate tools but are designed to be configured by expert programmers; unfortunately many webhosts deploy them indiscriminately.
ADVANCED_ADMIN_CACHE=Advanced Admin Cache
CONFIG_OPTION_advanced_admin_cache=Enable the Advanced Admin Cache, which loads fully cached pages for administrators whilst checking the server for any updates. The result is that you see a cached page for about 1 second until the latest version is retrieved, making browsing feel much snappier. This feature is a big innovation and hence highly experimental, and only works on the very fast modern web browsers: Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari. If your site is on a shared domain where other users can run their own Javascript code then you should not use it as it will lead to a serious security vulnerability.
ZONE_IS=Zone: {1}
TIME_ZONE=Time zone
OPTION_GROUPS=Option groups
OPTION_CATEGORIES=Option categories
DESCRIPTION_TIMEZONE_SITE=The time zone the site should report in. Note also that members have their own separate timezone setting.
DOC_CONFIGURATION=The configuration module is used to set most website options. The options are spread across multiple option categories, each containing option groups. Each of the options has a description underneath it to help you.\n\nMost configuration options do not need changing unless you want to divert from the default behaviour; the options that do need changing can be configured early-on using the Setup Wizard.
DOC_BASE_CONFIGURATION=To change an option set during installation, you generally use the external "Installation Options editor". The Installation Options editor is completely separated from the main software, so that if your site ever breaks due to a misconfiguration in the info.php configuration file, you can fix it without having to hand edit the file. As a result of the separation, the Configuration editor does not support multiple languages, and will not empty the caches automatically for you when you change an option, so after using it you should use the cleanup tools to empty the caches.
DOC_SETUPWIZARD=The first thing you will want to do after installing the software is to configure the name of your website, and other key details. The Setup Wizard will do this for you in a few easy guided steps and thus it is strongly recommended that you use it at any early stage.
DOC_HELPWIZARD=The help wizard is an alternative interface for website administration - it helps you learn how to perform common tasks. The aim of the help wizard is to ease your transition into the software.\n\nWhen you are logged in as site staff, you can find the help wizard icon at the bottom of every site page.
BASE_CONFIGURATION=Installation Options
SETUP_WIZARD_NOT_RUN=You have not yet run the <a href="{1}">Setup Wizard</a>. The wizard will help you get your site going, including making a layout, colour scheme, and logo.<br />If you do not want to run the Setup Wizard, you can <a href="{2}">remove this notice</a>.
SETUP_WIZARD=Setup Wizard
SETUP_WIZARD_STEP=Setup Wizard: Step {1} of {2}
SETUP_WIZARD_1_DESCRIBE=Welcome to the ocPortal Setup Wizard, and congratulations on a successful ocPortal install!<br />This Setup Wizard will allow you to quickly personalise/corporatise ocPortal. Be advised that if you have already started to configure your website, some of your changes may be overwritten by this wizard.
SETUP_WIZARD_1_DESCRIBE_ALT=The Setup Wizard has already been run once on this website. You may run it again if you wish, but it will overwrite many settings that have since been customised. You may also want to go and <a href="{1}">reinstall any addons</a> you previously removed so that any options relating to them become available again within the wizard. Like all ocPortal wizards, the Setup Wizard is a supplementary tool designed to avoid dropping you in at the deep end of ocPortal configuration &ndash; anything the wizard can do can be done, with a higher degree of control, elsewhere in the system.
SETUP_WIZARD_SAFE_MODE=<strong>Safe mode link</strong>: It is a good idea to <a target="_blank" title="bookmark this link: (this link will open in a new window)" onclick="if (typeof window.external!='undefined' &amp;&amp; typeof window.external.AddFavorite!='undefined') { window.external.AddFavorite(this.getAttribute('href'), 'My website in Safe Mode'); return false; } return true;" href="{1}">bookmark this link</a> to the safe-mode version. If a major problem develops when customising your site it disable your changes temporarily. In the rare event that you need the link, note that it only works when logged in as a super-administrator.<br /><br /><strong>Getting help</strong>: If you need help you can click the <img class="vertical_alignment" title="support button" alt="support button" src="{2}" /> button in the footer to see your support options. Bear in mind that community support relies on volunteers (like yourself?) and that people with serious projects should budget for proper commercial support.
SETUP_WIZARD_2_DESCRIBE=<p>ocPortal is an extremely flexible system: it is possible to make sites that are completely unique in look and feel without programming. Immediately after this wizard your site will still look fairly generic but you will be able to further customise your site with more detailed controls.</p>
WHAT_TO_EXPECT=What to expect from ocPortal
SETUP_WIZARD_2_DESCRIBE_EXPECTATIONS=ocPortal is built with 4 layers of control, all of which you have access to and all of which are fully documented; each successive layer provides more control, but requires more experience.<ol><li><strong>Unexperienced computer users</strong> will be able to create a generic but rich website.</li><li><strong>Experienced computer users</strong> will be able to create a highly featured website with it's own look &amp; feel.</li><li><strong>Intermediate web developers</strong> with a good understanding of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> will be able to implement their own designs exactly.</li><li><strong>Experienced programmers</strong> will be able to create totally new website features, or modify existing ones.</li></ol>ocProducts (the main developers of the software) have a lot of experience serving a wide-variety of users &ndash; we've thought about just about every feature that more than a minority would want and implemented it out-of-the-box, but the needs of some users are very unique, and websites increasingly complex, which is why we offer so much control as well as own professional consultancy and support services.
SETUP_WIZARD_3_DESCRIBE=Now enter some configuration details for your site. Some default values have been chosen for reference, but you will want to replace them with values of your own. In further steps defaults will also be chosen, but you are more likely to leave those later defaults alone.
SETUP_WIZARD_4_DESCRIBE=Which bundled addons would you like to keep installed? If you selected an install profile then we have tried to choose the right ones for you. You can change your addon selection easily from the Admin Zone later, so we suggest that if you don't think you'll want a feature that you let it get uninstalled to keep things fast and simple.
SETUP_WIZARD_5_DESCRIBE=What features and structure do you want?
SETUP_WIZARD_5x_DESCRIBE=By default, ocPortal has two public zones (site sections): a &lsquo;Welcome&rsquo; zone and a &lsquo;Site&rsquo; zone. This subdivision is useful:<ol><li>for presenting an isolated welcome page before users enter the main site</li><li>to force users to join your site (possibly by paying) before they have access to all content</li></ol>If you do not want to force users to join and do not want a separate welcome page, choose the &lsquo;Single public zone&lsquo; and enable &lsquo;Full guest access&rsquo;.
SETUP_WIZARD_6_DESCRIBE=Specify which of a selection of available blocks (positioned features which fit inside a box) you would like on your front pages and panels. A default arrangement has been chosen, but it is likely you will want a different one &ndash; corporate websites tend to use far fewer blocks favouring marketing copy and minimalism, whilst community websites tend to use lots.<br /><br />Once the wizard is finished it's likely you'll want to tweak your block arrangement, changing block parameters for example. This is done by editing the page the block is on, clearing the code for a block, then clicking the 'Add block' button to add a new block &mdash; you'll be given full guidance through the choice of block parameters.
SETUP_WIZARD_7_DESCRIBE=It is important for any website with a membership to have some rules, just like it is important for any real world community to have some rules. We have created some out-of-the-box rule sets for you to choose from, ranging from stricter rules that apply to a corporate setting, to very liberal rules (in that they are a lot less prohibitive) that apply to more freely expressive communities. For most websites the balanced rules are most appropriate. ocPortal also contains a privacy page which you may wish to edit at a later time.
SETUP_WIZARD_8_DESCRIBE=Enter a colour around which your website theme will be built. Your theme will be based around the default theme, but in your colour. There are lots of other themes you can find to install on the ocPortal website, some free, some commercial, and many of these may also be changed to a colour of your choice.<br /><br />It will take around 20 seconds (depending on your server) to generate your theme, and this will happen on the last step of the Setup Wizard. Some servers have bad configuration and will terminate a script if it takes more than about 10. If this happens (you can recognise by a blank screen or an 'Internal server error') just keep clicking refresh/reload in your browser until it finishes. The Setup Wizard is smart enough to be able to pick up where it leaves off.
SETUP_WIZARD_9_DESCRIBE=Choose whether to leave the website closed for now, or whether to open it to the public.
SETUP_WIZARD_10_DESCRIBE=Congratulations, the Setup Wizard has now completed! You may now continue to work on your website &ndash; you may wish to run through the Add-New-Page wizard a few times now, and then add some dynamic content such as downloads.
SETUP_WIZARD_RULES_balanced=Balanced rules
SETUP_WIZARD_RULES_liberal=Liberal rules
SETUP_WIZARD_RULES_corporate=Corporate rules
DESCRIPTION_RULES=The predefined rules. You may fully edit these later by editing the <kbd>:rules</kbd> page.
BLOCK_CONFIGURATION__PANEL_NO=Do not use this
BLOCK_CONFIGURATION__PANEL_YES=Use this
BLOCK_CONFIGURATION__PANEL_YES_CELL=Use this, but at 50% screen-width
BLOCK_CONFIGURATION__PANEL_NONE=Do not use this
BLOCK_CONFIGURATION__PANEL_LEFT=Use on the left panel
BLOCK_CONFIGURATION__PANEL_RIGHT=Use on the right panel
COLLAPSE_USER_ZONES=Single public zone
CONFIG_OPTION_collapse_user_zones=Whether the Welcome and Site zones should be identical. Identity eases navigation and reduces maintenance, but removes the potential separation advantages (e.g. easily having a paid site).
GUEST_ZONE_ACCESS=Full guest access
DESCRIPTION_GUEST_ZONE_ACCESS=Whether to give access to your main site for guests (users who are not logged in).
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__ADMIN=Options for interfaces that only staff can normally access, such as the Comcode page editor.
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__FEATURE=These are options relating to specific modules, as well as member interaction with modules (commenting and rating).
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__POINTS=Options related to points (but not the Point Store).
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__POINTSTORE=Options related to the Point Store.
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__SECTION_FORUMS=Options for the inbuilt forums, and member system. These are only relevant if the inbuilt forum system is actually being used.
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__SECURITY=Options relating to security.
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__SITE=Options relating to the general configuration of the site. These include descriptive options, cacheing options, &lsquo;closed site&rsquo; options, and general setup.
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__PRIVACY=Options relating to privacy and child-protection.
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__THEME=Options relating to the default theme, and most derived themes.
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__BLOCKS=Options relating to blocks (note that most block options are defined as parameters to blocks, not in here).
CONFIG_CATEGORY_BLOCKS=Block options
HTTPS_SUPPORT=HTTPS Support
CONFIG_OPTION_enable_https=If you would like to control whether to use HTTPS on a per-page basis, enable this. It is recommended you do not use this unless you need it, for performance reasons. You will also need the <kbd>ssl</kbd> addon installed.
DETECT_LANG_BROWSER=Detect language from browser
DETECT_LANG_FORUM=Detect language from account
CONFIG_OPTION_detect_lang_browser=If enabled, the language in which content is presented in will be detected from the language the visitor's web browser specifies. This is unreliable as unfortunately many people have misconfigured web browsers.
CONFIG_OPTION_detect_lang_forum=If enabled, the language in which content is presented in will be detected from the member's forum profile (if they have one). This takes precedence over detection from a browser.
UNZIP_DIR=Unzip directory
UNZIP_CMD=Unzip command
CONFIG_OPTION_unzip_dir=A safe directory path to which to unzip files. It is necessary to have this path outside the web root for security reasons.
CONFIG_OPTION_unzip_cmd=The command executed in order to unzip files. This depends on InfoZip being on your system; you may require a full path to the unzip command here.
STORE_REVISIONS=Store revisions
SHOW_REVISIONS=Revisions to show
MAXIMUM_DOWNLOAD=Maximum monthly bandwidth
MAXIMUM_USERS=Maximum users
USERS_ONLINE_TIME=Inactivity for considered departure
GZIP_OUTPUT=Gzipped output
MEMBER_FILTER=Filter group by website

ALLOW_AUDIO_VIDEOS=Allow audio as videos
SEND_ERROR_EMAILS_OCPRODUCTS=Send error e-mails to ocProducts
CHOOSE_A_CONFIG_CATEGORY=Please choose a configuration option category&hellip;
CONFIG_OPTION_send_error_emails_ocproducts=If this option is enabled, stack dumps and error messages will be e-mailed to ocProducts (the makers of the technology behind this website), to assist in fixing bugs promptly and with minimum hassle. If you are concerned about privacy for your website, disable this option.
CONFIGURATION=Configuration
CONFIG_CATEGORY_SITE=Site options
CONFIG_CATEGORY_ADMIN=Administrative options
CONFIG_CATEGORY_SECTION_FORUMS=Member and forum options
CONFIG_CATEGORY_FEATURE=Feature options
CONFIG_CATEGORY_PRIVACY=Privacy options
CONFIG_CATEGORY_SECURITY=Security options
CONFIG_CATEGORY_THEME=Theme options
CONFIG_OPTION_width_left=Enter the number of pixels for the width of the left panel.
CONFIG_OPTION_width_right=Enter the number of pixels for the width of the right panel.
CONFIG_OPTION_forum_in_portal=Tick (check) to have it always render within your website (this won't apply if someone visits the forum by direct URL).<br />Or, if you are using OCF with a multi-site-network, tick (check) this to make your forum appear to be running locally rather than having forum links direct to the central network site.
CONFIG_OPTION_forum_in_portal__ocf=If you are using a multi-site-network, tick (check) this to make your forum appear to be running locally rather than having forum links direct to the central network site.
CONFIG_OPTION_maximum_users=The maximum number of users who may be concurrently using the site before &lsquo;busy&rsquo; messages start to appear (only staff may continue to use the website whilst it is in this sense &lsquo;busy&rsquo;).
CONFIG_OPTION_users_online_time=The time that has to elapse in minutes before a user is considered to have moved off the site (i.e. a user is considered online if their last page load was less than X minutes ago).
CONFIG_OPTION_max_image_size=The maximum filesize in kilobytes that a non-staff member can upload for an image.
CONFIG_OPTION_gzip_output=If you would like to perform gzip compression on your HTML output to decrease download times for slower connections, at the cost of server CPU usage, enable this.
CONFIG_OPTION_log_php_errors=Put PHP errors into the errorlog.php file, which can be viewed by the Admin Zone (this is to see what errors have been occurring).
CONFIG_OPTION_display_php_errors=Display unfiltered fatal PHP errors (errors the software cannot catch) for non-staff. PHP errors can potentially reveal server environment details; it is recommended this option be turned off when you have the website working satisfactorily.
CONFIG_OPTION_mail_server=The DNS name of the SMTP server.
CONFIG_OPTION_thumb_width=The width of the thumbnails produced. The height is automatically scaled to match this width.
CONFIG_OPTION_default_lang=The default language for this website's content to be displayed and submitted. It is overridden if a user chooses their language manually.
CONFIG_OPTION_cc_address=Only fill this out if you want to receive a copy of every e-mail the website sends to your visitors (this could be quite a lot on a busy website).
CONFIG_OPTION_comment_text=The guide text posted on comment pages.
CONFIG_OPTION_super_logging=Tick (check) this if you want low-level details of every page hit to be logged. This is useful if you wish to view complete activity of any visitor, for purposes of analytics, debugging, or investigating security incidents. It does, however, require a lot of mySQL disk space.
CONFIG_OPTION_site_name=The universal name of your site.
CONFIG_OPTION_comments_forum_name=The forum in which all comment topics are created.
CONFIG_OPTION_copyright=The copyright notice. &lsquo;&amp;copy;&rsquo; represents the copyright symbol. If you wish to automate an end date you can use <kbd>$CURRENT_YEAR</kbd> like <kbd>Copyright &copy; ACME Corps, 2012-$CURRENT_YEAR</kbd> (it's your responsibility to make sure this is accurate, and the site truly is being updated continuously).
CONFIG_OPTION_closed=The text to display when your site is closed (in Comcode format).
CONFIG_OPTION_site_closed=Tick (check) this to close down your site to the public.
CONFIG_OPTION_welcome_message=The text displayed in the welcome block (which is on the front page by default), to welcome people to your site (in Comcode format).
CONFIG_OPTION_site_scope=The scope (topic) of your site. This should be a very short phrase that may be embedded within a sentence. For example, a site involving chocolate might choose &lsquo;chocolate&rsquo; as the scope. The software may then use the scope in a larger sentence, for example &ldquo;We hope that this is the best site for <em>chocolate</em> on the Internet.&rdquo;.
CONFIG_OPTION_description=This appears beside your site name in search engine results for any content pages that don't have their own descriptions/summaries.
CONFIG_OPTION_keywords=A comma-separated list of keywords for your site (made available to webcrawlers which look on your site).
CONFIG_OPTION_network_links=The URL to your network link file: if you are a part of a multi-site-network, this should be adjusted to point to the <kbd>netlink.php</kbd> file on your central network site (which must be running this software).
CONFIG_OPTION_staff_address=The e-mail address to which staff mail will be sent (this is not used much as most messages go out as notifications, which are available individually to each member of staff).
CONFIG_OPTION_logo_map=This is an HTML-style image-map, which defines how your logo can be clicked; leave it blank if you do not need to change it.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_gd=Is the GD image library installed and enabled on this server? This is a strongly recommended thing to have installed, as it allows auto-generation of image thumbnails.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_rating=Is rating of entries enabled?
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_comments=Is commenting of entries enabled?
CONFIG_OPTION_templates_store_revisions=Do we store revisions to templates?
CONFIG_OPTION_templates_number_revisions_show=How many revisions to show in the editing interface.
CONFIG_OPTION_mod_rewrite=Use mod_rewrite (only available to Apache server users, or IIS users with IIRF installed and configured) to make URLs cleaner and more search-engine friendly.
CONFIG_OPTION_session_expiry_time=The number of hours a session persists for without activity. A member not logged in with cookies, or using a session-requiring zone, will have to log back in after this time.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_trackbacks=Are trackbacks enabled? (Trackbacks are used for blog system interoperability &ndash; see documentation for more details).
CONFIG_OPTION_allow_audio_videos=Whether to allow audio files to be uploaded in place of videos (for instance, in the gallery addon).
CONFIG_OPTION_max_download_size=The maximum filesize a non-staff member can upload (in kilobytes).
CONFIG_OPTION_ocp_show_personal_last_visit=Show when the logged-in user was last active on the website (before his/her current session).
BEFORE_MOD_REWRITE=Before you may enable mod_rewrite support, you must enable it on the web server. If you used the quick installer then the installer will have tried to set this up for you in the <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file but did not manage it. This probably means that changes will need doing to the central server configuration. If you wish to try to change your <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file manually, look at <kbd>recommended.htaccess</kbd> or <kbd>plain.htaccess</kbd>.
CONFIG_OPTION_validation=Perform advanced output validation (for staff only), giving errors if technology guidelines are broken (such as XHTML5, CSS, and WCAG). If you enable this option you will be informed of any accessibility problems on your website, but we do not recommend enabling it as it severely effects performance as well as your administration experience.
SHOW_INLINE_STATS=Reveal usage figures
CONFIG_OPTION_show_inline_stats=Whether to show figures on various areas of your website that indicate how often those areas have been used.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_preview_validation=Whether to automatically perform standards validation upon previewing (enable this if you are particularly concerned with standards compliance).
STRONG_FORUM_TIE=Strongly tie content to the forum
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_strong_forum_tie=When this is unticked (unchecked) forum comment topics are created when the first comment is added. When this is ticked (checked) forum comment topics are created as soon as content is added (so that the forum can be monitored to see what new content is added), and also posting a comment directs to view the forum topic.
VALIDATION_ON_PREVIEW=Validation on preview
VALIDATION_XHTML=Validate <abbr title="eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML5</abbr>
VALIDATION_WCAG=Validate accessibility (<abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>)
VALIDATION_CSS=Validate <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
VALIDATION_JAVASCRIPT=Validate Javascript
VALIDATION_COMPAT=Validate for browser compatibility
VALIDATION_EXT_FILES=Validate referenced files
CONFIG_OPTION_validation_xhtml=Whether to check the XHTML5 is valid (XHTML-strict), rather than performing just a structural XML check.
CONFIG_OPTION_validation_wcag=Whether to check accessibility (does extra checks when checking XHTML and CSS).
CONFIG_OPTION_validation_css=Whether to check CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
CONFIG_OPTION_validation_javascript=Whether to check Javascript.
CONFIG_OPTION_validation_compat=Whether to check for browser compatibility (mostly to make sure features not supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 aren't used). <strong>Not recommended, as you will always get some false positives coming from the default software styles</strong>.
CONFIG_OPTION_validation_ext_files=Whether to also check that external files, such as CSS, iframes, and Javascript, are valid.
EXAMPLE_SITE_NAME=The website of defaultness
EXAMPLE_DESCRIPTION=Serving all your default needs and providing a community for celebrating all that is default.
EXAMPLE_SITE_SCOPE=defaultness
EXAMPLE_HEADER_TEXT=Spreading the word of default
EXAMPLE_COPYRIGHT=Copyright &copy;, default and default corps, 2006
EXAMPLE_KEYWORDS=default, defaultness, celebration, community
SIMPLIFIED_DONEXT=Simplified do-next scheme
CONFIG_OPTION_simplified_donext=Whether to adopt a simplified &lsquo;do-next&rsquo; scheme for administration. In this scheme, the adding/editing of an entry is succeeded by an immediate transition to the view page for that entry. This is useful if the site is being maintained by staff without much knowledge of the software.
CONFIG_OPTION_anti_leech=Whether to enable the anti-leech protection. This prevents 3rd party websites from linking directly to files on your site, which could potentially use up a lot of your bandwidth.<br /><br />Beware this can cause problems for users on some ISPs, or users in some restrictive/outdated environments (i.e. images not loading for them). It will also create problems on multi-site-networks.
ANTI_LEECH=Anti-Leech
MAIN_FORUM_NAME=Primary public forum
COMMENTS_FORUM_NAME=Comments forum
COMMENT_FORM_TEXT=Comment form text
SHOW_CONTENT_TAGGING=Show content tags
CONFIG_OPTION_show_content_tagging=Show the content tags (links to search for related content) when you view content screens.
SHOW_CONTENT_TAGGING_INLINE=Show content tags (inline)
CONFIG_OPTION_show_content_tagging_inline=Show the content tags (links to search for related content) for items of content when you view certain content lists.
PERSONAL_SUB_LINKS=Subscription links
CONFIG_OPTION_personal_sub_links=Show account upgrade links (OCF only). Links to all usergroup subscriptions will be shown to members who are not in any of the usergroup subscriptions you've set up and don't have Admin Zone access.
SHOW_SCREEN_ACTIONS=Show screen actions
CONFIG_OPTION_show_screen_actions=Show screen actions (for example, social media sharing links) when you view content screens.
FIXED_WIDTH=Fixed-width
CONFIG_OPTION_fixed_width=Whether the website is set to a fixed width, rather than scaling with the browser window. This is easier to design for (which is why most sites use it), but less flexible for the user.
CONFIG_OPTION_main_forum_name=The name of the primary forum, where certain kinds of automatic topic are created, including &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; topics.
CONFIG_OPTION_ocp_show_su=Show a box for administrators to masquerade as other website members (for testing purposes). For most themes (including the default theme) this is actually shown in the footer instead, so this option controls whether it shows in the footer.
CONFIG_OPTION_ocp_show_conceded_mode_link=Show a link for members to concede their session confirmation, which forces a re-confirmation of their login if they are to enter certain secure areas of the website. This is a half-way house between staying fully logged-in, and logging-out, useful if a logged-in workstation is about to be briefly left unsecured.
CONFIG_OPTION_ocp_show_staff_page_actions=Show a drop-down list of special staff actions in the footer that may be carried out upon/with-regard-to any screen they are viewing. For most themes (including the default theme) this is actually shown in the footer instead, so this option controls whether it shows in the footer.
CONFIG_OPTION_ocp_show_personal_adminzone_link=Show a link to their Admin Zone (if the member has access). On a default installation of this software, this link would also be provided in the list of zone links.
CONFIG_OPTION_bottom_show_admin_menu=Show a button that will popup an Admin Zone navigation menu for quick access to Admin Zone functionality (for those with Admin Zone access).
CONFIG_OPTION_bottom_show_top_button=Show a button that a visitor can click to make their browser scroll back to the top of the screen being viewed.
CONFIG_GROUP_DEFAULT_DESCRIP_STATISTICS=Show this in the &ldquo;Statistics&rdquo; block.
CONFIG_GROUP_DEFAULT_DESCRIP_USERS_ONLINE_BLOCK=Show this in the &ldquo;Users Online&rdquo; block.
CONFIG_GROUP_DEFAULT_DESCRIP_PERSONAL_BLOCK=Show this in the &ldquo;Personal&rdquo; block.
CONFIG_OPTION_activity_show_stats_count_users_online=Show the number of users currently using the website.
CONFIG_OPTION_activity_show_stats_count_users_online_record=Show the record number of users who have been on the website at once.
CONFIG_OPTION_activity_show_stats_count_users_online_forum=Show the number of users currently using the forum.
ALLOWED_POST_SUBMITTERS=Form-posting partner sites
CONFIG_OPTION_allowed_post_submitters=This relates to a security feature that prevents third-party websites from tricking you into submitting a malicious form. This field allows you to specify safe exceptions (i.e. if you have a partner site).<br /><br />Each line is any part of a URL (your choice which part), indicating that any URL containing that part will be allowed to direct web form submissions towards your website.
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_config=Configuration
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_setupwizard=Setup Wizard
SSW=Week starts on a Sunday
CONFIG_OPTION_ssw=Tick (check) this option if you want this website to consider Sunday the first day of the week (as opposed to Monday).
CONFIG_OPTION_root_zone_login_theme=Whether the welcome zone's theme is to be used for all login screens. This is advantageous if you want to hide zone themes/what those themes might imply. It also has the disadvantage that a broken welcome zone theme could make login very difficult.
CONFIG_OPTION_ip_forwarding=Tick (check) this if your server has IP-forwarding, and a strong outbound firewall (i.e. you are blocked to your own domain's external IP address). Also you can check this if you are running off of a Windows computer name rather than a proper DNS name. Otherwise, please do not enable this as it could cause complications on some server configurations.
CONFIG_OPTION_website_email=The e-mail address which e-mail will be sent 'from'. It is preferable for your e-mail to originate from your domain (the 'from' address being on your domain) so as to reduce the chance of it being filtered as spam. You should definitely ensure that the address's domain doesn't have an SPF record that doesn't allow your server to send (e.g. a gmail address).
CONFIG_OPTION_bcc=Whether staff CC-e-mails should be sent as BCC (i.e. the people receiving the e-mails can't see that the e-mail is also CC'd to the staff).
CONFIG_OPTION_htm_short_urls=<strong>For power-users only</strong>. Whether to use <kbd>.htm</kbd> style short URLs instead of the <kbd>pg/</kbd> style short URLs earlier versions of the software featured. You should not enable this option if you have already been using the older style of short-URL, as it will affect <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr>. This option only works if your website is on the root of your domain name or you have configured a <kbd>RewriteBase</kbd>. In addition, whenever you add a new zone you must make changes to your <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file (or <abbr title="Microsoft Internet Information Server">IIS</abbr> equivalent) to include it in the patterns, and you may not use any pages that share the same name as a zone.
CONFIG_OPTION_ip_strict_for_sessions=Whether sessions should be tied to IP addresses. If disabled, security will be lowered, but users on erratic internet connections (such as users moving rapidly between wifi zones) will not keep losing session-secured logins. Apart from lowering security, another disadvantage of disabling this option is it stops multiple users using the same username (which often happens during testing, or with a shared admin account). <strong>We recommend that you leave this option enabled</strong>.
CONFIG_OPTION_eager_wysiwyg=Whether the <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor should try and convert HTML to Comcode, and also clean-up markup, to make it readable. <strong>Not recommended</strong> if you ever hand edit HTML, as it will cause severe corruption to unrecognised HTML patterns.
CONFIG_OPTION_show_post_validation=Whether non-validated forum and Wiki+ posts/topics should count towards the total number of non-validated entries that is shown on the staff checklist.
CONFIG_OPTION_show_docs=Whether you want documentation links to the software-providers website to be displayed on areas of the website such as the Content Management zone.
CONFIG_OPTION_use_contextual_dates=Whether contextual dates (e.g. 'Today') should be used.
CONFIG_OPTION_enveloper_override=Whether to force the website 'from' address to be set using a command line parameter. Enable this if your server uses 'sendmail' for e-mail delivery, otherwise you should probably not enable this as it could cause problems with e-mail delivery.
CONFIG_OPTION_allow_ext_images=Whether to link to images in e-mails rather than embedding them within the e-mail itself. This reduces the data size of your e-mails (meaning they are quicker for users to download), but it means that many users might not see any images until they click a &ldquo;Load images&rdquo; button in their e-mail client. You may need to enable this option if HTTP-loopback is restricted by your web host.
CONFIG_OPTION_force_meta_refresh=Whether to use client-side (meta) refreshes rather than server-side (header) refreshes. Enable this if you are using an old version of IIS on your server, to workaround a bug in it.
SHOW_DOCS=Enable documentation links
SHOW_POST_VALIDATION=Tally non-validated posts
EAGER_WYSIWYG=Convert XHTML to Comcode

HTM_SHORT_URLS=Use new style short URLs
MAIL_QUEUE=E-mail queue
MAIL_QUEUE_DEBUG=E-mail debug mode
CONFIG_OPTION_mail_queue=Whether e-mail is sent via a queue. This is highly advisable to balance out server load, and might actually be necessary on some servers if a lot of members are listening for notifications on the same content. You will need the system scheduler set up for this to work.
CONFIG_OPTION_mail_queue_debug=Whether all e-mail will be held in the queue rather than sent, and you need to edit/force-send/delete items manually. This is very useful when first debugging a sophisticated website, if you are concerned e-mails might not be going out in adequate condition, or spurious e-mails might be sent. If you have this option enabled then disable it, the e-mail queue will be processed quickly afterwards (so make sure you have deleted any inappropriate emails from the queue first).
CONFIG_OPTION_low_space_check=When the server has less than this amount of free disk space (in megabytes), send out a notification.
NO_STATS_WHEN_CLOSED=Don't collect stats when closed
NO_BOT_STATS=Do not log bot hits

ENABLE_PREVIEWS=Enable previewing
ENABLE_KEYWORD_DENSITY_CHECK=Enable keyword density check when previewing
ENABLE_SPELL_CHECK=Enable spell check when previewing
ENABLE_MARKUP_VALIDATION=Enable <abbr title="eXtensibile Hypertext Markup Langage">XHTML</abbr> validation when previewing
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_UPLOAD=These options control maximum upload file sizes. Maximum upload size depends on a number of factors:<ul><li>the PHP option <kbd>post_max_size</kbd> (currently {1})</li><li>the PHP option <kbd>upload_max_filesize</kbd> (currently {2})</li><li>the options here</li><li>and, usergroup daily-upload-quotas (settable when editing usergroups).</li></ul>
UPLOADED_FILES=Uploaded files
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_PERSONAL_BLOCK=The personal block is the block formally named <kbd>side_personal_stats</kbd>, and could also be known as the &ldquo;Login block&rdquo;. If you are not logged-in it provides a login form, otherwise it provides various options and details relating to your member account.
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_STATISTICS=The site statistics block is the block formally named <kbd>side_stats</kbd>, and provides information about your website. You will have chosen whether to use this block or not when you ran the Setup Wizard. It can be added and removed using the Zone Editor.<br /><br />Most of the options here are counts illustrating how much content is currently on your website.
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_ENVIRONMENT=These settings relate to your web server configuration, and also to multi-site-networks. If you do not know what a multi-site-network is, you may ignore those options.

IS_ON_EMOTICON_CHOOSERS=Enable emoticon choosers
DEEPER_ADMIN_BREADCRUMBS=Extended Admin Zone breadcrumbs
HAS_LOW_MEMORY_LIMIT=Force memory conservation
IS_ON_COMCODE_PAGE_CHILDREN=Allow tree structures of Comcode pages
GLOBAL_DONEXT_ICONS=Provide CMS/Admin Zone icons after actions
CONFIG_OPTION_user_postsize_errors=Whether to show 'submission possibly too big'-style messages when the software detects a bad web request that could be due to an upload limit being exceeded. Disable this option if you are confident you have configured your PHP liberally and do not want to confuse users with reference to such limits.
CONFIG_OPTION_automatic_meta_extraction=Automatically extract meta-keywords/tags from the body of submitted content, via some simple statistical analysis.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_emoticon_choosers=Display a large sets of emoticon choices directly on forms. Disable this if you do not expect people to want to use emoticons very often.
CONFIG_OPTION_deeper_admin_breadcrumbs=Whether to show Admin Zone breadcrumbs that show what overall section you're in, rather than just the current position you are in a specific module.
CONFIG_OPTION_has_low_memory_limit=Enable this if you're using a server that has a low memory limit that cannot be overridden, but where PHP incorrectly (due to a modified PHP version) reports the limit as off ('1 &amp; 1' hosting accounts do this). This will put the software into a mode where it optimises itself to preserve memory, and instead be a bit slower.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_comcode_page_children=Whether to allow Comcode pages to be children of other Comcode pages, hence forming a tree structure. More complex sites will benefit from such a structure, although most sites will work just fine just being able to store pages under a choice of zone.
CONFIG_OPTION_global_donext_icons=Give do-next managers a set of general Site/CMS/Admin Zone jump icons, as well as contextual icons.
JAVA_UPLOAD=Java/FTP uploading
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_JAVA_UPLOAD=This mechanism allows users to upload files via Java/<abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> (not <em>Javascript</em>, Java, so the Java plugin is needed on user's PC's for the functionality to activate for them). To enable it you need to have sophisticated programming skills as you need to <a target="_blank" title="compile a certificate into the Java code: (this link will open in a new window)" href="http://ftp-uploader.sourceforge.net/">compile a certificate into the Java code</a>. You also need to set up an FTP account that ties into the software's <kbd>uploads/incoming</kbd> directory. A SuExec server may also be required. You must make sure that scripts cannot run from any FTP-accessible directory, for security reasons: so it is best to set the FTP directory to head straight into the <kbd>uploads/incoming</kbd> directory and then protect that (default <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file provided for this). Users must have J2SE 5.0 or later; without it, functionality falls back to Flash or HTML upload. The advantage is file uploads can resume part-way if they fail, essential if you are supporting very large uploads.
ENABLE_JAVA_UPLOAD=Enable Java/FTP uploads
CONFIG_OPTION_java_upload=Whether to enable Java/FTP uploads. Please check the above advice first, this is advanced functionality.
JAVA_FTP_HOST=FTP hostname
CONFIG_OPTION_java_ftp_host=The hostname that Java will connect to for the FTP transfer.

CONFIG_OPTION_java_password=The password Java will use. Be aware this will become publicly available for any end-user that digs around in your <abbr title="HyperText markup language">HTML</abbr>.
JAVA_FTP_PATH=FTP path
CONFIG_OPTION_java_ftp_path=The FTP path Java will connect to. This must be to your <kbd>uploads/incoming</kbd> directory. For security it is best you lock down the FTP account such that you can enter <kbd>/</kbd> here.
FORUM_CURRENTLY_UNSET=You currently have no valid selection for the '{1}' option. When you save this form, the Home forum will be used unless you set something different.
FILE_SYSTEM_CACHING=File-system caching
CONFIG_OPTION_filesystem_caching=Use file-system cacheing for the block cache (amongst others), instead of the database. This is only recommended for servers where the database has a limited capacity or where database load is a problem.

This option depends on the Google Analytics markup not having been removed from the <kbd>HTML_HEAD.tpl</kbd> template.
INSTALLPROFILE=Install profile
DESCRIPTION_INSTALLPROFILE=You can optionally choose the closest install profile to preset your site with. This will choose sensible defaults for the rest of the wizard and also simplify your menus for a more compact/tailored navigation.
ADDONS_NOT_INSTALLED_IN_SETUP_WIZARD=You have some uninstalled addons, which may be because you have run the Setup Wizard before. The Setup Wizard will have reduced functionality if not all addons are installed as it won't know about the services they offer. You can reinstall adons from <a href="{1}">addon management</a>.
CONFIG_OPTION_long_google_cookies=Whether to store more accurate Google Analytics tracking cookies. <strong>As this technique uses automated cookies, it may not be legal in the European Union.</strong>
CONFIG_OPTION_remember_me_by_default=Whether to enable the remember-me login feature by default. <strong>As this technique uses automated cookies, it may not be legal in the European Union.</strong>
CONFIG_OPTION_detect_javascript=Whether to attempt to auto-detect presence of Javascript using cookies or a redirect. This option is not ideal because it forces user-agents that do not have cookies enabled to go through a redirect when they reach the website. We recommend you leave it off as there is a bookmarkable link in the default footer to use the no-Javascript version of the site for the tiny minority of users who disable Javascript. <strong>As this technique uses automated cookies, it may not be legal in the European Union.</strong>
LONG_GOOGLE_COOKIES=Store full Google Analytics cookies
REMEMBER_ME_BY_DEFAULT=Recommend &ldquo;Remember me&rdquo;

CONFIG_CATEGORY_ACCESSIBILITY=Accessibility
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__ACCESSIBILITY=Options that help users with special access needs. The software is highly accessible out-of-the-box, but if you have special needs (such as a visual impairement) then changing these options may help you in administrating your website.
CONFIG_OPTION_complex_uploader=If you want Javascript/Flash/Java&amp;FTP functionality to be present. These advanced uploaders may not work well with screen-readers.
CONFIG_OPTION_wysiwyg=If you want the WYSIWYG editor.
CONFIG_OPTION_editarea=If you want to enable the fancy HTML/CSS editor.
CONFIG_OPTION_autoban=If you want detected hackers to be automatically banned. You may wish to disable this if there is some kind of false-positive being triggered (there shouldn't be though!). Potentially hackers could use the hackattack system to get innocent people banned by directing them to malicious-appearing URLs, so if this ever happens, disabling this option could be necessary.
CONFIG_OPTION_js_overlays=If you want Javascript overlays to be used instead of browser-based windowing. The Javascript overlays are good if you're using a full-screen browser, a tablet or mobile device, don't like 'ugly' default dialogues, have concerns with popup blockers that you can't easily train your staff to disable (common), or generally prefer to keep webpages intrinsic. However overlays can cause big problems for some screen-readers.
CONFIG_OPTION_likes=If you want to have simple like/dislike buttons instead of asking users to use a ratings scale.
CONFIG_OPTION_tree_lists=If you want to have Javascript/AJAX-powered category selection lists. This is more user-friendly to sighted users who are adding content and essential if you have hundreds of categories, however is not so easy to understand with a screen-reader and keyboard navigation.
COMPLEX_UPLOADER=Enable complex uploader
ENABLE_WYSIWYG=Enable WYSIWYG

This option determines the level of checking performed. Note that the Stop Forum Spam service is intended to be non-commercial, so if you have a for-profit site you should negotiate an arrangement with them. Note that most checks only work if <abbr title="The inbuilt software forum">OCF</abbr> is being used.
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_check_level_VALUE_EVERYTHING=Every page view (performs RBL checks always, and full check on actions)
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_check_level_VALUE_ACTIONS=Actions (joining, posting, trackbacks)

You will also be able to syndicate reports when you use the &ldquo;Investigate user&rdquo;, &ldquo;Action Log&rdquo;, &ldquo;Punish Member&rdquo; and &ldquo;Delete Trackbacks&rdquo; software features. You may manage your syndicated submissions on the <a target="_blank" title="Stop Forum Spam website (this link will open in a new window)" href="http://www.stopforumspam.com/myspammers">Stop Forum Spam website</a>.
TORNEVALL_API_USERNAME=Tornevall API username
CONFIG_OPTION_tornevall_api_username=If a <a target="_blank" title="tornevall API (this link will open in a new window)" href="http://dnsbl.tornevall.org/wiki/soapclient">tornevall key</a> is set up, enter the Username here. IPs will then be syndicated out like with the Stop Forum Spam service.
TORNEVALL_API_PASSWORD=Tornevall API password
CONFIG_OPTION_tornevall_api_password=If a <a target="_blank" title="tornevall API (this link will open in a new window)" href="http://dnsbl.tornevall.org/wiki/soapclient">tornevall key</a> is set up, enter the Password here. IPs will then be syndicated out like with the Stop Forum Spam service.
SPAM_BLOCK_LISTS=<abbr title="Remote block list">RBL</abbr> servers
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_block_lists=A comma-separated list of <abbr title="Remote Block List">RBL</abbr> servers designed for sharing spam blocking information. If you have an <a title="HTTP:BL key (this link will open in a new window)" href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/httpbl_configure.php">HTTP:BL key</a>, you may set up HTTP:BL by putting in <kbd>&lt;key&gt;.*.dnsbl.httpbl.org</kbd> (put it first, as it is the best data for web systems and will be prioritised if given first). Only certain servers are supported fully (unrecognised servers will work, but without any settings granularity, due to a lack of any common <abbr title="Remote Block List">RBL</abbr> standard).
SPAM_CACHE_TIME=Block list cache time
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_cache_time=The number of minutes to cache spam block list requests.
SPAM_CHECK_EXCLUSIONS=Spammer checking exclusions

SPAM_STALE_THRESHOLD=Spammer staleness threshold
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_stale_threshold=Only consider IP addresses that have been detected as malicious within this previous number of days.
SPAM_BAN_THRESHOLD=Spammer ban threshold
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_ban_threshold=If spammer confidence is above this percentage then the user will be given an error message then immediately put into the software IP ban list (for the configured period of time).
SPAM_BLOCK_THRESHOLD=Spammer block threshold
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_block_threshold=If spammer confidence is above this percentage then requests will be blocked with an error message. This only applies to requests that perform a content submission/join action.

SPAM_CHECK_USERNAMES=Check usernames for known spammers
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_check_usernames=Whether to check usernames during the Stop Forum Spam check. This may result in false-positives if spammers were using very generic usernames, and doesn't really work as a reliable filter (it is easy to use lots of different usernames).
SPAM_BLACKHOLE_DETECTION=Blackhole detection
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_blackhole_detection=If enabled, hidden inputs will be placed on all submittable forms. No human would fill these hidden inputs, but bots would. If filled in, spam hack-attack alerts will be generated.
