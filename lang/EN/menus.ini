[strings]
DOC_MENUS='menus' usually reside on panel-pages [no_parse]('panels')[/no_parse] which are placed around the main section of the website. They consist of links which may be organised in a tree structure, and displayed in various ways (for example, as popup menus, or expansion menus).
DOC_PHP_INFO=You can display information about the PHP server environment via a page PHP itself provides called 'PHP info', which shows all the technical details of the PHP configuration, such as the installed PHP extensions and the defined options.\n\nSome PHP options can be defined in the '.htaccess' file (Apache non-CGI web server users only), as illustrated by the default [tt]recommended.htaccess[/tt] file. On CGI servers you need to use a custom [tt]php.ini[/tt] file instead (see our FAQ). Full details of this are in the [url="PHP manual"]http://www.php.net/docs.php[/url].\n\nThe PHP info is also convenient for identifying wider factors of the system environment, such as server paths.
DOC_ADMIN_ZONE=As a webmaster, it is important that you are able to monitor and control every facet of your website. This is possible through the Admin Zone: the heart of your website.
DOC_STRUCTURE=Structure is very important to your website: without a solid structure, your website would just be a jumble of information and features. Structure provides navigation and organisation.
DOC_USAGE=The audit section of the Admin Zone contains all the logs for various aspects of your website, as well as visual representations of activity, and tracking features.
DOC_STYLE=Presentation is key - without it, your website content and functionality are likely not to even be discovered. This section of the Admin Zone is where you can change the appearance of your website. The software has exceptional themeing support, with a whole range of features from simple personalisation by filling in a few form fields, to advanced programming features to completely restructure the layout of your website.\n\n[b]You can find additional contextual style tools in the footer, where it says &lsquo;(Select page rendering tool)&rsquo;.[/b]
DOC_SETUP=In this section of the Admin Zone you will find tools to setup your website. This may be the area you spend most time in initially, but visit less and less over time. If this is your first visit, we recommend you use the 'Setup Wizard' to quickly set the most important options in a user-friendly way.\n\nThe software has a core system as well as addons: some of what you would consider essential to your website may be provided by addons (because what you might consider essential for your website might be considered unnecessary clutter for others). Official addons can be installed or uninstalled at any time, and (depending on experience) you can also install or make other addons as desired (the system is highly extendable).
DOC_TOOLS=These are tools to accomplish specific website tasks. Most tools here are advanced and you need not have any understanding of them: as your website grows, you may however find them very useful.
DOC_SECURITY=This section allows you to modify all settings related to security (including staff, usergroups and censorship).\n\nThere is a vast array of settings here, particularly the 'Permissions tree editor', which you will find very useful for identifying and setting permissions across your whole website.\n\nocProducts takes all security considerations very seriously, so many internal security mechanisms are provided that you shouldn't need to manually configure. Thus, they are not presented in this section.
DOC_WRITING=Pages can be edited with the [abbr="What You See Is What You Get"]WYSIWYG[/abbr] editor, but you can add in extra things such as blocks or text effects, using Comcode (that's what the square brackets are for).\n\n[title="3"]A note on accessibility[/title]\n\nWhen writing for any kind of publication, it is important to use clear language which is appropriate for the audience you are targeting. Using good grammar and spelling not only makes your text correct, but most importantly, it makes it easier to read and understand - a small conscious effort will lead to a significant improvement for all your readers.\n\nFor your text to be accessible to those with certain kinds of disability, you should make sure:\n - colour is not used alone to convey information\n - text is well-spaced into logical paragraphs\n - if you are writing a long piece of text, consider using headings and an index (the software can maintain the index for you if you use the 'contents' Comcode tag)\n - Specify the expansion of each abbreviation or acronym in a document where it first occurs\n - Place distinguishing information at the beginning of headings, paragraphs, and lists, so that your text may be quickly understood on its first read\n - use clear, precise, and understandable language: avoid complex words unless there is a good reason for them
MISSING_CAPTION_ERROR=All captions must be filled-in
MISSING_URL_ERROR=All URL fields for childless branches must be filled-in
CONFIRM_OVERWRITE_LINK=Are you sure you wish to overwrite the currently selected link?
ABOUT_DELETE_MENU=There is rarely a reason to delete a menu, but if you do wish to, click the &lsquo;Delete&rsquo; button. Please note that if you have blocks referencing this menu and you delete it, those blocks will indicate that there is a &lsquo;missing menu&rsquo;.
ADD_BRANCH=Add branch (e.g. another link)
BRANCH=Branch
BRANCH_TYPE=Branch type
CONTRACTED_BRANCH=Contracted branch
EXPANDED_BRANCH=Expanded branch
LINK=Link
ENTRY_POINTS_DESCRIPTION=&lsquo;Entry points&rsquo; are a special kind of &lsquo;page-link&rsquo; that you may jump into without any special further parameters. For example, the <kbd>downloads</kbd> module (if installed) lets you jump into the root category, and Comcode pages allow you to jump in arbitrarily as they take no parameters. You can choose from the entry points available within the website below (once you have selected a menu branch).
BRANCHES_DESCRIPTION=Menus consist of &lsquo;branches&rsquo;. Branches may hold child branches, or may just be links. Whether branches with children may have links of their own, or are allowed, depends on the type of menu.<br />Note that this menu editor does not define the style a menu is rendered in or its box title &ndash; this is defined separately, according to what parameters are used with the <kbd>side_stored_menu</kbd> block (usually edited in the Zone Editor).</p><p>Note that menu structure (what's on what menus) is entirely separate from site structure (zones) and category/Comcode page structure. To control site structure, use the <a href="{1}">Site Tree Editor</a>. Category/Comcode page structure is controlled from the add/edit screens of individual categories/Comcode pages.<br /><br /><strong>Tip</strong>: You can jump between the branches and field editing areas by double clicking text fields.

For example, <kbd>_WILD:_WILD:type=ad</kbd> then the link will only show on &lsquo;ad&rsquo; screens. If you want to prevent guests seeing this link, you can do a little trick of entering some Tempcode in here that limits their viewing of this link to an unmatchable match-key, e.g. <kbd>{$?,{$IS_GUEST},_never_}</kbd>.
MENU_ENTRY_URL=An URL, or a page-link/entry-point (which you can pick to the right).
MENU_ENTRY_BRANCH=May just link to a page, or be initially expanded/contracted with children. Will be ignored for <abbr title="These menu types: zone, embossed, select, top">flat menu types</abbr>.
