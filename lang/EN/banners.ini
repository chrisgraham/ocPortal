_DESCRIPTION_BANNER_TYPE=A banner will only be shown if the <kbd>banner.php</kbd> script is called up asking to display banners of its type (the &lsquo;General&rsquo; type is the default). An example banner type might be &lsquo;skyscraper&rsquo;, and those would be shown if <kbd>{$BANNER,skyscraper}</kbd> was placed in an appropriate place in the templates.

DESCRIPTION_IMPORTANCE_MODULUS=This determines how regularly the banner will show. A good way to think of it is if you add all the importance moduli of the different banners and consider that a number of minutes (currently <span id="im_total" class="im_{1}">{1}</span>), this banner will on average show for the given number of those total minutes (<span id="im_here">{2}</span>).<br />In short: this banner will show for <span id="im_here_2">{2}</span> out of <span id="im_total_2" class="im_{1}">{1}</span> minutes.

BANNER_TITLE_TEXT=Title text / trigger text
DESCRIPTION_BANNER_TITLE_TEXT=The title text for textual banners (NB: you can only add textual banners to a banner type that has been configured for them). Also serves as the hot-text in Comcode that will trigger the banner to be shown inline/contextually (only applies if the textual banner type also has &ldquo;Works as Comcode hot-text&rdquo; enabled).

DESTINATION_URL=Destination URL
DESCRIPTION_UPLOAD_BANNER=If you want to upload a file from your computer.
DESCRIPTION_URL_BANNER=If you want to supply an existing image URL, or you want to point the banner to a rotation script. If you use a banner script you must use an absolute URL.
PERMISSION_BANNER_SKIP=You have permission to avoid banners, thus you will not see any banners display on this website even if there are some active ones. Super-administrators always have this permission. If you'd like to test your banners you'll need to use another member account.
IMPROPERLY_FILLED_IN_UPLOAD_BANNERS=You did not provide an upload or you tried to upload a file that exceeds the file-size limit, and you did not specify an image URL either. As you were adding to a non-textual banner type you needed to specify a valid upload or URL.
IMPROPERLY_FILLED_IN_BANNERS=You tried to submit to a textual banner type but did not fill in the 'Title text / trigger text' field.
CONFIG_OPTION_banner_autosize=Enable this if you do not want the software to force banner media files to be of a certain inherent size, and instead use HTML to force widths. This option will not preserve aspect ratio, only fit-to-width. This option is particularly useful if you have to reference external media files (e.g. image-view tracking URLs) and thus have no control over the exact dimensions.
CONFIG_OPTION_admin_banners=Whether to show banners to administrators (this is like denying them the permission to avoid banners, and this option exists to bypass that normally you cannot deny administrators any permission).
