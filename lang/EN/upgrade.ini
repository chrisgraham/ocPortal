FU_UPGRADER_TITLE=ocPortal upgrader
FU_UPGRADER_INTRO=This is the ocPortal upgrade tool. This tool is a part of ocPortal, but it is intentionally kept lightweight to keep it working even if ocPortal is partly broken.
FU_LOGIN_INFO=Once you log in you will be presented with some options to help you upgrade or perform maintenance on your ocPortal-powered website.
FU_LOGIN_INFO_PASS_FORGET=If so, find the <kbd>admin_password</kbd> line of your <kbd>info.php</kbd> file and put in a new temporary password (the one written there won't work because it is encrypted). Once you have done this you should promptly use the <kbd>config_editor.php</kbd> script to change the password, as this will save it again as encrypted.
FU_LOGIN_FORGOT_PASSWORD_Q=Forgot your password?
FU_CHOICES=The following choices are available to you:
WARNING_FILE_OUTDATED=<p>The following files have been superseded by new versions, but you have overrides/customisations blocking the new versions. Look into this and consider reincorporating your changes into our new version. If this is not done, bugs (potentially security holes) may occur, or be left unfixed. If you edited using an inbuilt editor, the file on which you based it will be saved as <kbd>file.editfrom</kbd>: you may use a tool such as <a href="http://winmerge.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">WinMerge</a> to compare the <kbd>editfrom</kbd> file to your own, and then apply those same changes to the latest version of the file.</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_FILE_ALIEN=<p>The following alien files were found in ocPortal and possibly should be deleted. It may be that these files are remnants of the previous version or files from uninstalled addons (these ones are pre-ticked/checked), and they may cause problems if left behind. Please check each file to see what it is, and if you believe it to be an outdated file, delete it. Please take a backup first though!</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_FILE_ADDON=<p>The following files relating to non-bundled addons were found in ocPortal and probably should be deleted if you have done a major upgrade. They may not be compatible with the version you are currently running. If you delete the files you will be able to restore them by importing the latest version of the addons involved (ocPortal will help you with this from the Admin Zone).</p><ul>{1}</ul>
FILE_MOVED=A module file, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, was apparently moved from the &ldquo;<kbd>{2}</kbd>&rdquo; zone to the &ldquo;<kbd>{3}</kbd>&rdquo; zone previously.
NO_UPGRADE_DONE=<p>No specific upgrade needed to be done.</p>
AUTO_MERGED=[don't worry this has just been automatically merged using the <kbd>.editfrom</kbd> file, and a revision backup has been taken]

FU_UPGRADED_BLOCK=Upgraded block <kbd>{1}</kbd>

FU_ALL_CHMODDED_GOOD=<p>All permissions are correct.</p>
WARNING_FILE_CHMOD=<p>The following files have incorrect permissions:</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_MOVED_MODULES=<p>The upgrader has detected that some ocPortal modules were probably previously moved. However because the new ocPortal files have been uploaded, the new ocPortal module files are back where they used to be. You therefore need to do the moving again, overwriting the old versions that were previously moved.</p><ul>{1}</ul>

FU_UP_INFO_1=The on-disk version of ocPortal is <strong>{1}</strong> and the in-database version is <strong>{2}</strong>. This means the database is currently up-to-date.
FU_CLOSENESS=(The website is currently <em>{1}</em>)
FU_UP_INFO_2=The on-disk version of ocPortal is <strong>{1}</strong> and the in-database version is <strong>{2}</strong>. This means a database upgrade has not yet been completed.

FU_THEME_UPGRADE_FINAL=Go ahead and upgrade themes
FU_WILL_MERGE=This will attempt to merge in default theme changes to your custom theme CSS. This is not perfect, it will likely result in some small theme errors that you would need to fix manually.

FU_TUTORIAL=Carefully (re)read the upgrader tutorial

FU_FILE_UPGRADE_INFO=<p>Whenever ocProducts makes a new version of ocPortal news is posted on <a target="_blank" title="ocportal.com: (this link will open in a new window)" href="http://ocportal.com/site/pg/news">ocportal.com</a>. Your Admin Zone will inform you and link direct to that news post. The news post will contain the URL to an upgrade TAR file that you may use to update your site &ndash; feed that URL in here and the ocPortal upgrader will automatically extract it to the server, skipping files from official addons that you uninstalled.</p>
FU_FILE_UPGRADE_INFO_MANUAL=<p><strong>Important:</strong> This extraction step can be a bit precarious for large upgrades. If it does not finish correctly you can upload the contents of the TAR file manually.</p>
SITE_OPEN=Open
SITE_CLOSED=Closed
FU_AUTO_HANDLE=Automatically handle those ticked (checked) &ndash; delete/move as needed
WARNING_FILE_OUTDATED_ORIGINAL_AND_OVERRIDE=<p>The following non-overridden files are outdated, as are the corresponding overridden files (you can find the correct versions for the original in the manual installer ZIP for the version you're running, but the overrides may still cause problems and might need removing/replacing):</p><ul>{1}</ul>

WARNING_FILE_FUTURE_FILES=<p>These files do not match the ones bundled with your version, but claim to be newer (so these might be bug fixes someone has put here):</p><ul>{1}</ul>
EXTRACTING_MESSAGE=<strong>Extracting files</strong>. Please note that if execution halts without message during file extraction then the operation has not completed due to a timeout. If this happens (it can do on a small proportion of servers) try refreshing a few times to see if this works. If it still does not work, you will need to manually extract the files from the upgrade TAR.
