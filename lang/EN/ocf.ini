[strings]
DOC_ADD_MEMBER=In some rare situations, it is useful for the staff to be able to add members to the site themselves, without having to log out, join the normal way, and then log back in as staff.
DOC_EDIT_MEMBER=Member editing is done by browsing to the profile of that member and choosing a link from there. Member profiles contain a wealth of links, acting as the hub for member control and tracking.\n\nThis icon will direct you to the member list, which is outside of the Admin Zone.
DOC_MEMBERS=Under here you can perform various actions relating to members, including adding, editing, exporting, importing, and other forms of maintenance.
DOC_SECONDARY_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP=Secondary usergroup membership editing is done by browsing to the usergroup you would like to control membership for and choosing an action from there.\n\nThis icon will direct you to the usergroups list, which is outside of the Admin Zone.
DOC_MERGE_MEMBERS=The ability to merge members is only of occasional use, but when you find you do need it, it can be a great help. The usual situation is that one member gets 'bored', feels 'victimised', or wants to go 'undercover' (often, talking with their other account to 'hide the fact'), and creates themselves a second username. This may be a violation of your rules, depending which you have chosen, but is often annoying; it can usually easily be noticed just by seeing that two members have the same personality, spelling and language habits, usage patterns and IP address.\n\nIt is worth noting, that you should not be overly suspicious, as members who share some of the listed characteristics, may simply be family members in a household that shares an Internet connection.\n\nThe merge member feature will attempt to reassign everything attached (in any way) to the 'from' member to the 'to' member.
DOC_LDAP=If you plan to integrate your website into a corporate network, perhaps as your intranet, you may wish to use the same credentials for users of the website as you do for your other services, such as desktop login. With this approach, there are a number of advantages:\n - There is no issue with preventing non-authorised users joining, or having to manually validate accounts of those who do join.\n - Users do not need to join.\n - A user only has a single password to maintain.\n - It is clear who the users of the website are, as there is no potential for them to use unknown handles.\n - Usergroup membership is the same as on your corporate network, and permissions can be assigned using it.\n\nThe standard protocol for sharing of network credentials is called [concept]LDAP[/concept]. Two variations of LDAP are supported:\n - [concept]Active Directory[/concept], which is a standard part of the Windows architecture.\n - [concept]OpenLDAP[/concept], which is the de-facto standard for Linux systems.
DOC_GROUPS=Members exist in a primary usergroup, and may be placed in any number of secondary usergroups. Usergroups serve many purposes, including:\n - demonstrating rank\n - grouping members for common permission allocation\n - demonstrating involvement\n\n'Applying' to usergroup leaders to join usergroups is supported, as well as point-based usergroup progression (rank).
DOC_CUSTOM_PROFILE_FIELDS=The 'Custom Profile Fields' allow you to create new data fields to attach to member profiles. By default, an 'About me' field is included, and a number of hidden/locked/non-editable fields that store details relating to point counts, and staff-membership and role.
DOC_CUSTOM_PROFILE_FIELDS_STATS=View tallies of how popular different Custom Profile Field values are. 
DOC_FORUMS=Discussion forums are a communication tool for site users, based around topics of conversation located within forums.\n\nDiscussion forums are organised into a hierarchical structure (also known as a tree structure). The forum you view when you visit the [concept]discussion forums[/concept] is the [concept]home forum[/concept] in the hierarchy, and contains child forums ([concept]sub-forum[/concept]s), which may themselves contain child forums, and so on. Within each forum there may also be [concept]topic[/concept]s (known as threads in some other software). And within each topic, there are one or more [concept]post[/concept]s.
DOC_FORUM_CATEGORIES=Apart from forums, topics, and posts, there is one additional organisational construct in the inbuilt forum system: forum groupings (known as 'categories' in some software). However, forum groupings have a very limited effect on organisation. The system stores a number of groupings, and any forum, at any position in the tree can be 'tagged' against one of these groupings: the groupings have no effect on, and are not a part of, the forum structure, and all they do is group up sub-forums of the same forum grouping visually. By default, every forum is of the forum grouping 'General' and hence all sub-forums are grouped under this when displayed.
DOC_EMOTICONS=Emoticons (also known as smilies) are little images used to convey 'emotion' within text. These are an important part of informal communication on the Internet, as body language and tone are not available to (sub-consciously) transmit the same information.\n\nWithout use of emoticons, it can be impossible (unless the writer took great care to express themselves fully) to gauge unwritten details, such as the importance of what is being written, or the writer's emotional perspective on it.
DESCRIPTION_USERGROUP_TITLE=The human-readable name of the usergroup.
MEMBER_LEADS_GROUP={1} leads the usergroup &lsquo;{2}&rsquo;

LDAP_SYNC=LDAP synchronisation
LDAP_INTRO=The website will take usergroup membership and authentication from an LDAP server in real-time, for all LDAP members. Certain standard LDAP usergroups are mapped to standard website usergroups (e.g. &lsquo;admin&rsquo; becomes &lsquo;Administrators&rsquo; on the website). This all means that website members require zero setup and maintenance, as all permissive elements run directly from LDAP. This tool allows you to synchronise website usergroups with LDAP, and delete orphaned website LDAP members who are no longer actually in LDAP anymore (whilst these could not login, it is cleaner for them to be gone).
LDAP_SYNC_MEMBERS_DELETE=The following LDAP members are defined for the website, but no longer in LDAP. Choose which to remove:
LDAP_SYNC_GROUPS_ADD=The following LDAP usergroups are not on the website. Once they are in, the website will automatically pick up when LDAP members are in these usergroups. Choose which usergroups to add:
LDAP_SYNC_GROUPS_DELETE=The following custom website usergroups are not in LDAP. It is best to use a common usergroup set between the website and LDAP, as LDAP members may only be in LDAP usergroups. Choose which usergroups to delete:
LDAP_MEMBER_DISALLOW=This action is not possible for LDAP members.
DUPLICATE_JOIN_AUTH=The username you entered exists in a supported external authentication system. It is reserved for use by the user in that system. If you are that user, you may login here using your normal password.
LDAP_DISABLED=LDAP has not been enabled in your configuration, or the PHP LDAP extension is not installed. You must configure LDAP in the &ldquo;Forum and member options&rdquo; category of the Configuration module (available under the Setup section of the Admin Zone) before you may use it. In order to use LDAP, you will need a working LDAP server with a POSIX (aka NIS) schema, or a Windows Active Directory server. If you do not know what this is, then you shouldn't be using LDAP &ndash; it is intended for providing unified authentication for corporate networks.
JOIN_DISALLOW=This site is setup to only allow members from an external authentication system. Members must be added via that system.
LDAP=LDAP
LDAP_CANNOT_CHECK_PASSWORDS=This LDAP server does not support &ldquo;Manual authentication checks&rdquo;, do you need to disable that option.

WHISPER_PP=Use this to create a post within the topic you came from that only you, <em>{1}</em>, and certain high-privileged staff, may see.<br />Inline personal posts are clearly indicated so that members may distinguish them from ordinary posts.<br /><br />You can also create an inline personal post to a different member from here, if you have his/her username - by changing the &ldquo;Whisper&rdquo; field on the form.
FORUM_CACHE_CLEAR=After importing, you must reset the forum statistics using the <a target="_blank" title="Website cleanup tools: (this link will open in a new window)" href="{1}">Website cleanup tools</a>. If you do not do this, incorrect information will be displayed in the forum, such as incorrect forum topic counts.
REORDER_FORUMS=Reorder forums
CHOOSE_FORUM_EDIT=From this page you may choose a forum to edit. Forums are organised in a tree structure, with the &lsquo;home&rsquo; forum being where a user starts when they view the forum zone.

Forums are also organised into shared forum groupings, but this is a purely cosmetic process, and has no bearing on where the forums are displayed.

DESCRIPTION_FLOOD_CONTROL_ACCESS_SECS=The number of seconds that need to pass before users can open up site pages (we anticipate most sites will want this left at zero).

DESCRIPTION_IS_SUPER_ADMIN_B=<br /><br /><span class="red_alert">Note that unticking (unchecking) this will result in the usergroup having no permissions.

This e-mail contains the confirmation code, which you may use in one of two ways. The first way is to just click the first link in the e-mail, which feeds in the confirmation code automatically.

The code is also provided in the e-mail, near this second link.
