[strings]
DOC_LOGOWIZARD=A 'Logo Wizard' is provided that will create you very simple site logos (the logos in the top-left of your website). It is recommended that you use this tool to create your initial logo and consider making your own customised logo at a later point.
DOC_THEMEWIZARD=An 'Automatic theme generator' is provided that will generate themes based on the default theme but tailored according to the parameters (such as colours) you define. This will allow you to create an individual look to your website, without going through the full artistic and technical process of theme generation. The results are of course limited (conversely virtually anything can be done using the manual themeing process), but good enough for many websites.\n\nBe aware of the following small deficiencies:\n - some default software emoticons are animated, and attractive animated images have to be saved to a particular background colour -- so you may wish to uninstall these animated emoticons or rework them in an image editor.
DOC_THEMES=Your website's entire appearance, from its layout, to its images, and color schemes all make up a 'theme'. These themes are completely customisable by you, given a moderate knowledge of XHTML5 (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
DOC_MARKUP=Templates are almost all written in [url="XHTML5"]{$BRAND_BASE_URL}/docs{$VERSION}/pg/tut_markup[/url] and [url="Tempcode"]{$BRAND_BASE_URL}/docs{$VERSION}/pg/tut_tempcode[/url], and hence a good knowledge of XHTML5 is required for editing them. This is moderately advanced functionality, not intended for novices - although by all means expand your horizons![staff_note]\n\nIn order to preserve the high web standards the software is designed for, it is recommend that during development you have 'validation' enabled in the configuration to make sure that these standards are not degraded. Of course, this is your choice, and you may choose whatever level of standards support you believe is appropriate to your website.\n\nPlease note that the validator cannot perform a limited number of some of the markup accessibility checks, so [url="to make an accessible website"]{$BRAND_BASE_URL}/docs{$VERSION}/pg/tut_accessibility[/url] you must manually make sure you conform to these guidelines:\n - Use a 'noscript' tag wherever appropriate\n - Do not use elements for semantically incorrect uses (such as list tags for non-lists, or the [tt]blockquote[/tt] tag solely for indentation)\n - avoid using animation effects\n - Do not rely on colour as the sole indicator for important information\n - Always provide 'alt' (alternate) content for media, and avoid media where suitable markup alternatives exist[/staff_note]
DOC_CSS=Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) control most visual aspects of your website. Editing CSS files directly is advanced functionality, not intended for novices - although we encourage you to expand your horizons! Novices may wish to use the Theme Wizard to create a customised colour scheme.\n\nIf you want to make an accessible website for those with visual impairements, make sure that you use sufficient contrast between colours. You may wish to use the validator to check your CSS.\n\nReferences like "[tt]{$GET,area_text}[/tt]" are used by the Theme Wizard to create pleasing colour combinations -- they are associated with equation lines like [tt]{$THEME_WIZARD_COLOR,#325180,area_text,76% seed + 24% WB}[/tt]. If you like you can either edit the colour in the line (you can ignore the equation), or you can replace the reference with a colour directly.\n\n[tt]{$IMG;,example}[/tt] refers to a theme image. You can edit these through the Admin Zone, the easiest way is to just search the Admin Zone for [tt]example[/tt].
DOC_TEMPLATES=Did you know that you rarely need to manually choose a template to edit via this screen? Instead, you may use the &lsquo;Template tree&rsquo; feature to see what templates were used to generate the screen you are viewing, and then choose to edit from there. You'll never be left guessing what templates you need to edit, or navigating through to the Admin Zone again. The &lsquo;Template tree&rsquo; feature is accessed via the 'Select page rendering tool' list in the footer of any screen you are viewing.

LOGOWIZARD=Logo Wizard
_LOGOWIZARD=Logo Wizard: Step {1} of {2}
LOGOWIZARD_1_DESCRIBE=This is step 1 of the Logo Wizard. The Logo Wizard will help you quickly create a logo for your website, and apply it to the theme currently used on the main website. The logos generated are very simple, so more professional sites will only wish to use the generated logo as a placeholder. The whole appearance is fully customisable using the theme management features &ndash; the main logo is just a theme image named <a href="{1}"><kbd>logo/-logo</kbd></a>.
LOGOWIZARD_3_DESCRIBE=Your logo has now been applied to the theme <kbd>{1}</kbd>.
DESCRIPTION_LOGO_NAME=The name of your website, company or organisation (short names are best).
DESCRIPTION_LOGO_SLOGAN=A few short words that form a slogan (this will appear underneath the name). For example, &lsquo;Lighting the path forward&rsquo;.
LOGO=Logo

THEMEWIZARD=Theme Wizard
_THEMEWIZARD=Theme Wizard: Step {1} of {2}
THEMEWIZARD_1_DESCRIBE=This is step 1 of the Theme Wizard. The Theme Wizard will help you quickly create a theme around a colour of your choosing, which you will be able to fully edit later.
THEMEWIZARD_4_DESCRIBE=You saved <kbd>{1}</kbd> as &lsquo;{2}&rsquo;.
SEED_COLOUR=Seed colour
DESCRIPTION_SEED_COLOUR=The colour around which all other colours in the theme will be built. Click within the colour spectra to adjust each of the colour components until you are satisfied with the chosen colour.

THEMEWIZARD_2_SAMPLE_TITLE=Sample title
INHERIT_CSS=Inherit CSS from default theme
DESCRIPTION_INHERIT_CSS=Whether to reference the default theme's CSS and apply a filter to it, rather than copy it all in. This option allows your theme CSS to upgrade between versions with greater ease, because you only specify your changes. However the big down-side is it makes the CSS harder to understand because you don't have it all in front of you.
REFRESH_TO_FINISH=It will take around 20 seconds (depending on your server) to generate your theme. Some servers have bad configuration and will terminate a script if it takes more than about 10. If this happens (you can recognise by a blank screen or an 'Internal server error') just keep clicking refresh/reload in your browser until it finishes. The Theme Wizard is smart enough to be able to pick up where it leaves off.

DESCRIPTION_DELETE_THEME_IMAGE=Delete this theme image. This theme image is either a non-default image, or an image that has been given a new picture via uploading. Deleting the image will delete the referenced uploaded file (as long as it is not used elsewhere), and delete the theme images' entry in the image map (for all themes and languages that use it). If the theme image is still referenced somewhere, the software will try and recreate it via URL-autodetection, as is done initially for all default theme images.
DELETE_THEME_IMAGE=Delete theme image

THEMES_AND_ZONES=Different zones (site sections: groups of pages) can be configured to use different themes. You have the following zones&hellip;
DESCRIPTION_THEME_IMAGE_NAME=A codename for the theme image. This looks like a short-hand file-path, and new (unrecognised) image codenames are actually auto-found based on searching file-paths (out of <kbd>themes/&lt;theme&gt;/images_custom</kbd> or <kbd>themes/&lt;theme&gt;/images</kbd>, in the active theme and then the default theme). Once in the system, however, there is no requirement that an image codename actually be a real file-path.
USE_ALL_THEMES=Use for all themes
USE_ALL_LANGS=Use for all languages

DESCRIPTION_USE_ON_ZONES=Automatically assign this theme as the default theme on all zones (except the Admin zone and CMS zone). Note that leaving this action-choice unticked (unchecked) will not reverse the setting. To reverse the setting either:<ul class="compact_list"><li>each zone must be edited to select which theme to use (if any);</li><li>or, another theme must be edited with this action-choice ticked (checked).</li></ul>
USE_ON_ZONES=Use theme on all zones
TEMPLATE=Template
EDIT_THEME=Edit theme
NEW_TEMPLATE=Create a new template. This feature is of use if writing new code, or creating a new standard box.
UNRESOLVABLE_COLOURS=The following colour equations could not be resolved, most likely because required colour(s) were not defined anywhere, or because mathematically, there is no solution:<br /><kbd>{1}</kbd>. <strong>Your chosen source theme probably does not support the Equations method, so try the HSV-shift method instead.</strong>
FROM_COLOUR=Default colour
TO_COLOUR=Chosen colour
DARK_THEME=Dark theme
DESCRIPTION_DARK_THEME=Whether the theme will be a dark theme; for most websites, we would recommend keeping the theme light. Please note that this option is not fully supported, it may lead to some visual artefacts &ndash; but the developers aim to fix any so please report any problems as bugs.
SUPPORTS_WIDE=Supports wide pages
DESCRIPTION_SUPPORTS_WIDE=Some pages in the software may request that panels are not shown to make extra space, but it will only happen on themes that support it (many themes won't be smart enough to be able to change their layout like this).
MOBILE_PAGES=Mobile pages
DESCRIPTION_MOBILE_PAGES=A comma-separated list of page names that should be renderable with QVGA mobile-browsing mode, for phones such as Android or Apple iPhone. If you leave this blank all pages will be considered renderable with this. You will likely want to set it if your site has lots of very custom graphics that aren't designed to scale down. All default software pages support QVGA well.

THEME_MAPPING=Theme mapping
DESCRIPTION_THEME_MAPPING=You may map this theme to skins on your externally-powered forum. This allows automatic theme detection based on the forum-skin-preference of members.
THEME_EXPORT=Exporting/Importing themes
TEMPLATE_CHOOSE_TO_EDIT=Choose a template to edit, either by searching by template contents, or by choosing an existing template.<br /><br />Be aware that it is usually <strong>a lot easier to find a template to edit using the &lsquo;show template edit links&rsquo; feature</strong> that shows the templates used by whatever screen you are viewing at the time (available from the &ldquo;Select page rendering tool&rdquo; list in the footer of any screen you are viewing).
CSS_CHOOSE_TO_EDIT=Choose a CSS file to edit. Site-wide styles come from <kbd>global.css</kbd>, and browser-specific styling comes from <kbd>no_cache.css</kbd>.<br /><br />Be aware that it is usually <strong>a lot easier to use the &lsquo;contextual CSS edit&rsquo; feature</strong> that provides an interactive editor for whatever screen you are viewing at the time (available from the &ldquo;Select page rendering tool&rdquo; list in the footer on any/every screen).
THEME_USED_ON=This theme is used for the following zones: {1}
THEME_DEFAULT_FOR_SITE=(<em>all that are unassigned</em><sup>*</sup>)
MEMBERS_MAY_ALTER_THEME=Members may alter their theme selection via their member profile; this will apply to any zone that has no pre-selected theme.
DEFAULT_THEME_BY_SITENAME=This is the <em>site</em>-default theme as its codename corresponds to your site-name.
DEFAULT_THEME_BY_FORUM=This theme is the <em>site</em>-default theme as it is bound to the forum's default theme.
DEFAULT_THEME_BY_DEFAULT=&ldquo;Default Theme&rdquo; theme is being used as the <em>site</em>-default theme as you have no theme with a codename corresponding to your site-name. If you did, that would become the <em>site</em>-default theme.
DEFAULT_THEME_INHERITANCE=Theme files are taken from this theme if they are not defined in the active theme.
DESCRIPTION_CODENAME_THEME=The codename for the theme (this is used as a directory name).
DESCRIPTION_CODENAME_THEME_HELPER=The codename for the theme (this is used as a directory name). If you would like to make this the new <em>site</em>-default theme, enter &ldquo;{1}&rdquo; here.
ADDING_THEME_IMAGE=You may also add a new theme image. You will only need to do this if you are creating new modules, or adding new images for your theme that have no built-in direct equivalent in the default theme. <strong>If you have already placed your image into your theme <kbd>images_custom</kbd> directory</strong> then it will add automatically when it is first referenced (with a code based on it's filename).
THEME_IMAGE_CURRENTLY_LIKE=Your theme image currently looks as shown in this box. It has dimensions of <strong>{1}</strong>x<strong>{2}</strong>.
THEME_IMAGE_CURRENTLY_UNMODIFIED=This image file is currently inherited from the default theme. If you edit it, it will be overridden, so that your theme has its own version of the image.
RIGHT_CLICK_SAVE_AS=If you want to edit this image, right click on it and ask your web browser to save it, then blank out the URL field and attach your new copy to the Upload field.
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_themes=Themes
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_themewizard=Theme Wizard
DESCRIPTION_LOGOWIZARD_THEME=The theme to create the logo in. Note that the logo will also be created in the default theme, as that is usually used in the Admin and CMS zones. If you are running multiple languages, the logo will be created for the language you are personally using now.
DESCRIPTION_AUTHOR_THEME=The author of this theme.
DESCRIPTION_ADD_THEME_MANUAL=Use this form to add a new empty theme. You may wish to consider the <a href="{1}">Theme Wizard</a> instead, if you'd like a new colour scheme automatically generated.
THEME_ALSO_INCLUDE_PAGES=Also include the ticked (checked) Comcode pages in the theme. This is useful if your theme depends on certain block layouts, for example. Commonly you may want to export panel(s) and start page(s). The user installing the theme will get a choice whether to take your Comcode pages or not, and if they choose to their own pages will be backed up as the last revision.
EXISTING_THEMES=Existing themes
ADMIN_SCREENS=Administrative screens (you probably don't need to theme these)
COPY_THEME=Copy theme
DESCRIPTION_COPY_THEME=Copy this theme to the given new codename, leaving the old one intact under the existing codename (<kbd>{1}</kbd>).

DESCRIPTION_SOURCE_THEME=The theme that you will be basing your new theme off. This source theme will be taken and recoloured by the wizard.
THEMEGEN_ALGORITHM=Theme Wizard algorithm
DESCRIPTION_THEMEGEN_ALGORITHM=How the Theme Wizard should generate your colours.<br /><br />&ldquo;Equations&rdquo; uses Theme Wizard equations built-into the theme <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to generate the colours based purely on the seed you enter; the default theme has these equations consistently defined and the software has extra inbuilt support to make the theme images look great too. If you select this option and a theme does not support it you may not see much happen.<br /><br />&ldquo;HSV-shift&rdquo; works by comparing your source theme's existing seed colour, and the seed colour you enter, and shifting all the colours across across correspondingly. It should work on all themes, although source theme authors may need to configure their <kbd>theme.ini</kbd> file with details of any new theme images they've made that need to be re-treated (by default only a selection of the default theme images are recoloured).
THEMEGEN_ALGORITHM_EQUATIONS=Equations
THEMEGEN_ALGORITHM_HSV=<abbr title="Hue/Saturation/Value">HSV</abbr>-shift
