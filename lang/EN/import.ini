IMPORT_SESSION_EXISTING_REMAP=Resume the previous import session ({1})
IMPORT_SESSION_CURRENT=Continue the current import session ({1})
REFRESH_TIME=Refresh time
DESCRIPTION_REFRESH_TIME=It is not easy for web systems to import large bodies of data, because they work on a page request model. PHP/Browsers will time-out if a page takes too long to load: halting the import. Our import system is re-entrant and automatically reloads: please enter the number of seconds between requests.
IMPORT_OF_SKIPPED=Import of <kbd>{1}</kbd> is skipped for now because it depends on <kbd>{2}</kbd> to be completed. You should go back and re-import this once the dependency has been satisfied.
IMPORT_NOT_IMPORTED=We cannot continue due to a missing dependency. <kbd>{2}</kbd> of type <kbd>{1}</kbd> is missing. There may be a small corruption in your database &ndash; if you contact us (ocProducts) with a copy of the database, we may be able to work around it and get you an updated importer.
IMPORT_WARNING=It is recommended that you only import one thing at a time, to reduce the effect of failure. The importer system is designed to be very robust and streamlined, but the wide variety of data presented to it leads to the occasional difficulty. If you find the importer will not import your data, we may be able to assist you; please contact ocProducts.
FROM_IMPORTING_SYSTEM=File-system path to the import source. This must point to a working installation of the software.
_FROM_IMPORTING_SYSTEM=Part of the access details for the ocPortal database. This must be a correct specifier of where the database of the ocPortal site being imported is currently located.
