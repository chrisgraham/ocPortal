WHAT_IS_COMCODE=What is Comcode?
COMCODE_ERROR_HELP_A=<p>Comcode is text embellished with square-bracketed tags and other forms of &lsquo;syntax&rsquo;. You can just type text as it would look on the screen, and Comcode will usually display it just as you typed it: however Comcode can do a lot more, such as change text colour and font size, or even create animations and display the latest site news.<br /><br />All Comcode syntax must meet the rules of Comcode. These rules are simple once understood, and most errors occur due to small mistakes.<br /><br />To learn how to write Comcode, click the blue &lsquo;c&rsquo; icon next to any form field (all form fields that support Comcode will show it).<br /><br /><span class="associated_details"><a href="#help" target="_self">General repair advice</a> is at the bottom of this screen&hellip;</span></p>
COMCODE_ERROR_HELP_B=<p>The vast majority of Comcode mistakes are when the writer does not close all tags, in the opposite order to that in which they are opened (e.g. <kbd>[i][b]text[/i][/b]</kbd> and <kbd>[i][b]text[/i]</kbd> are both wrong, whilst <kbd>[i][b]text[/b][/i]</kbd> is correct).</p><p>This error fixing screen will allow you to fix your mistake. The line number where the error was detected is shown, and a numbered display of the lines you wrote is also shown. Please be aware that the line the actual position of the error is not always the same as the detected position: it's not possible to always find the true cause of errors, so the software will try and guess. If the error is not immediately obvious, check your code very carefully.</p>

COMCODE_TAG_title_PARAM_number=Set to a comma-separated list of list-style codes, as used by the contents tag: this will cause numbering to be placed before titles (defaults to no numbering, and a blank value may be used for default numbering).

COMCODE_TAG_no_parse=Do not parse the contents of the tag, but otherwise display as normal.
COMCODE_TAG_no_parse_EMBED=The text.

This tag is particularly handy if you're using complex Comcode (e.g. Tempcode directives or the if_in_group tag) and you want to be able to use white-space to layout your code (semihtml does not have 'hard white-space' -- if you do want spaces, use the HTML br tag and the nbsp entity). Note that this tag does not work in the WYSIWYG editor: to enter HTML in the WYSIWYG editor use the 'View source' feature and paste it in directly. Also note that purely textual syntaxes like emoticons will not work from inside semihtml for stability reasons, only HTML and Comcode tags work.
COMCODE_TAG_semihtml_EMBED=Comcode and HTML mixed freely.

COMCODE_TAG_overlay_PARAM_timein=The number of milliseconds until the overlay is displayed (defaults to 0).
COMCODE_TAG_overlay_PARAM_timeout=The number of milliseconds until the overlay is hidden, measured from the timein (defaults to -1, which means there is no timeout).
