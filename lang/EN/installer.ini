[descriptions]
DATABASE_HOST=English: Database hostname. Explanation: A 'host' is a computer which holds something. In this case, the computer on which the given database is running.
FILE_BASE_EXAMPLE=English: /home/you/httpdocs. Explanation: Translate 'you' only.

[strings]
SUEXEC_SERVER=You appear to either be on a suexec server. That's great because it means your site will be more secure and you will not need to set the extra permissions mentioned in the installation tutorial.
RECURSIVE_SERVER=You appear to be on a server with permissions already set. This may be because you're on a Windows or Mac server and the <abbr title="Access Control Listing">acl</abbr>s are set to grant 'recursive access'. Therefore you will not need to set any of the permissions mentioned in the installation tutorial.
TROUBLESOME_WINDOWS_SERVER=You appear to be on a Windows server, without recursive <abbr title="Access Control Listing">acl</abbr> settings set. Read the <a title="advanced installation: (this link will open in a new window)" target="_blank" href="http://ocportal.com/docs/tut_adv_installation.htm">advanced installation</a> tutorial for advice.
INSTALL_SLOW_SERVER=This server appears to have a relatively slow hard disk, or is overloaded &ndash; we had to skip checking the integrity of the uploaded files as it was taking too long.
FTP_FIREWALL_ERROR=You appear to have a firewall on your server somehow preventing <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> data transfers that originate from the server. Sorry, you'll need to use the manual-extraction installer instead of this quick installer.
NO_BLANK_TABLE_PREFIX=The table prefix must not be blank
INST_POST_ERROR=The licence must be agreed to. If you did agree to the licence, then you may be running the installer from a URL that does invisible redirections that cause form data to be lost. Try variants of the installer URL with and without <kbd>www.</kbd> in it &ndash; if problems still occur, contact your web host.
ADVANCED_BELOW=You may change the advanced settings below if you wish, but it is not recommended.
INST_SUBSCRIPTION_LEVEL=Subscription level
NO_GD_ON_SERVER=There is no PHP GD extension on the server (no PHP graphics functionality). Officially ocPortal requires this, and a number of very useful features will not work without it (such as automatic thumbnail generation).
NO_XML_ON_SERVER=There is no PHP XML availability on the server (the PHP XML extension is not available). This means certain functionality, such as the displaying of <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> and Atom feeds, will not be able to function.
MYSQL_TOO_OLD=You are using a very old version of mySQL. Officially ocPortal requires version 4.1 or higher. If you wish to proceed, upload an empty file to your ocPortal installation directory named <kbd>mysql_old</kbd> (no file extension). The existence of this file will indicate to ocPortal that certain features must be disabled. It is highly desirable for mySQL to be upgraded instead, as your version is relatively ancient.
LOW_MEMORY_LIMIT=Your server has a very low PHP memory limit, and ocProducts cannot guarantee that ocPortal will be able to function within this limit. Once you have installed, please try renaming the bundled recommended.htaccess file to .htaccess, as this will try and raise the memory limit (if that causes errors, you'll need to rename it back and create a custom php.ini, as described in our FAQ). ocPortal officially requires a minimum 16MB limit, but 32MB is recommended. If you cannot override or change the limit, consult your webhost; ocPortal may function to some degree, but problems will occur in numerous areas if more than a little content is added.
NO_PHP_DB=There are no PHP extensions loaded for database handling. At least one MySQL-compatible PHP extension is required. Please consult the system administrator of this server.
NO_ZIP_ON_SERVER=There is no PHP ZIP extension on the server. Batch importing from ZIP files (this is not a common activity) will not work until ZIP support is enabled/configured (either via the extension, or via configuring ocPortal to use the InfoZip alternative).
WARNING_DB_OVERWRITE=<p><span class="red_alert" role="alert">Warning:</span> if you are trying to upgrade your current ocPortal installation, <strong class="up_alert">stop here</strong>. By continuing with this installation, you will overwrite the database of your current installation and destroy any customised or uploaded files stored on disk. That previous installation (if still present) will <strong>not</strong> continue to function and will be <strong>irretrievable</strong> without backups.</p><p>If you are trying to upgrade your ocPortal installation, use the <strong>upgrader.php</strong> script from the new version, as instructed in our <a target="_blank" href="http://ocportal.com/docs/pg/tut_upgrade">upgrading tutorial</a>. The installer and installer archive files are never involved in an upgrade.</p><p><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Only</span> proceed if you're prepared to overwrite your current ocPortal installation.</p>
WARNING_MBSTRING_FUNC_OVERLOAD=The PHP <kbd>mbstring.func_overload</kbd> setting is not set to <kbd>0</kbd>. This PHP setting is explicitly advised against in the PHP manual and will cause numerous unexpected behaviours inside ocPortal and other scripts, so needs to be disabled. Unicode works in ocPortal without this option.
FORUM_BASE_URL_UNCHANGED=You have not changed the forum base URL. If this URL is incorrect, aspects of your system will malfunction. Are you sure you wish to proceed?
FORUM_BASE_URL_INVALID=You may not install ocPortal into the same directory as your forum.
CORRUPT_FILES_LOWERCASE=Some of your filenames have lost their case. It is crucial that you do not pass ocPortal's files through a process that can lead to this, as ocPortal treats files with case sensitivity.
CORRUPT_FILES_CROP=Some of ocPortal's filenames have been cropped. You have most likely extracted them using an old operating system. ocPortal cannot survive this.
MISSING_FILES=ocPortal appears to be missing critical files. You have most likely not uploaded all necessary files. If possible, use the quick installer.
MISSING_INSTALLATION_FILE=An ocPortal file, <kbd>{1}</kbd> is missing &ndash; it needs to be uploaded.
CORRUPT_INSTALLATION_FILE=An ocPortal file, <kbd>{1}</kbd> is corrupt &ndash; it needs to be re-uploaded (ignore this if the file has been intentionally edited).
_MISSING_INSTALLATION_FILE=There are <strong>{1}</strong> missing ocPortal files that need to be uploaded:
_CORRUPT_INSTALLATION_FILE=There are <strong>{1}</strong> corrupt ocPortal files that need to be uploaded:
DISABLED_FUNCTION=An important PHP function, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, has been intentionally disabled on this web server. This essentially means the PHP language isn't fully available on this server &ndash; you may not be able to use ocPortal on it, depending on how the specific function is used.
WARNING_DISK_SPACE=You have less than 25MB of disk space remaining.
WARNING_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=Your server is configured to give only a few seconds for the slowest pages to load. This is a cause for concern.
WARNING_MAX_INPUT_TIME=Your server is configured to only wait less a minute for file uploads to finish. This is a cause for concern.
INSTALLED_OCF=Installed ocPortal forum system (OCF)
INSTALL_MODULE=Installed module <kbd>{1}</kbd>
INSTALL_BLOCK=Installed block <kbd>{1}</kbd>
CREATED_CUSTOM_PROFILE_FIELDS=Created custom profile fields
CHMOD_PASS=CHMODing worked
CHMOD_FAIL=CHMODing failed. This may be because the server might be running Microsoft Windows. If your server is setup to allow write access by default, this is fine. Otherwise you will need to perform CHMODing according to the install guide.
PRIMARY_CORE_INSTALLED=The primary part of the core system has been installed
SECONDARY_CORE_INSTALLED=The secondary part of the core system has been installed
PASSWORDS_DO_NOT_MATCH=The given passwords do not match
CONFIRM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=Important: the master password is used for core configuration and maintenance access. Please store it in a safe and secure place. {1}
CONFIRM_ADMIN_PASSWORD_2=The password is also used to login with the default <kbd>{1}</kbd> username.
COOKIE_SETTINGS=Cookie settings
USE_MSN=<strong>Advanced</strong>. Do you intend to join a network of multiple ocPortal sites sharing a forum (you will need access to the shared <abbr title="Database">DB</abbr>)?
USE_MULTI_DB=<strong>Advanced</strong>. Do you intend to have your forum and portal data each in different databases (third party forums only)?
REQUIRES_MORE_INFO=(requires more information)
ADMIN_USERNAME=Administration account username
DESCRIPTION_ADMIN_USERNAME=The username with which the first user account will be created. (i.e. your username).
ADMIN_USERS_PASSWORD=Administration account password
DESCRIPTION_ADMIN_USERS_PASSWORD=Choose a password for the above account.
CLEAR_EXISTING_FORUMS_ON_INSTALL=Clear existing forums on install
DESCRIPTION_CLEAR_EXISTING_FORUMS_ON_INSTALL=Type &lsquo;yes&rsquo; if you wish to erase the contents of this forum (if it does not already exist, it will be created, and this option doesn't matter). ocPortal forums (and users and usergroups) may be shared between many sites.
BOARD_INSTALL_NUMBER=Board install number
VB_UNIQUE_ID=Licence number
VB_UNIQUE_ID_DESCRIP=This is your licence number which came with vBulletin. It is at the top of all vBulletin source files.
NO_PHP_FTP=Unfortunately your server's installation of PHP does not have <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> ability. You must either choose the manual installer or petition your webhost to provide this facility.
I_AGREE=I agree to this legally binding agreement
ADVERTISE_ON_OCPORTAL=I do not mind being listed on ocportal.com as a featured user
EMAIL_NEWSLETTER=If you would like to sign up to our (English) newsletter, enter your e-mail address and choose an interest level. You may change your preferences via ocportal.com at any time.<br /><br />If you choose &ldquo;Interesting updates&rdquo; or &ldquo;Any and all updates&rdquo; then you will also receive some automatic guide e-mails designed to introduce you slowly to ocPortal.
MASTER_PASSWORD=Master password
FTP_USERNAME=FTP username
FTP_PASSWORD=FTP password
FTP_DOMAIN=FTP hostname
FTP_DOMAIN_NOT_LIKE_THIS=The FTP domain name should not include <kbd>ftp://</kbd> or any other special syntax. It is the IP address or domain name of the server (e.g. <kbd>example.com</kbd>).
FTP_DIRECTORY=FTP directory
NO_FTP_ACCESS=We could connect to the FTP, but we received an access denied error
NO_FTP_DIR=The FTP directory that was given is not valid; you likely entered the wrong FTP path. The FTP directory must be the same as that in which the installer is located. You may be able to find the path by looking at the path displayed in your FTP software (or the path component of the FTP URL if you uploaded using a web browser). If you can not get the quick installer to work, you may need to consider using the manual installer instead [Full error: {1}. Case: {2}]
NO_FTP_CONNECT=Cannot connect to the FTP server (if you are running on a non-standard port, try specifying this with a colon and then the port name)
NO_FTP_LOGIN=Could not login to the FTP server [{1}] (if you are running on a non-standard port, try specifying this with a colon and then the port name)
FTP_FOLDER=This should be the <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> path on the server of the directory from which this installer is running. Common examples: <kbd>/</kbd>, <kbd>/httpdocs/</kbd>, <kbd>/(installdir)/</kbd>, <kbd>/httpdocs/(installdir)/</kbd>, <kbd>/subdomains/(subdomain)/httpdocs/</kbd>, <kbd>/subdomains/(subdomain)/(installdir)/</kbd>, or <kbd>/httpdocs/subdomains/(subdomain)/(installdir)/</kbd>. Sometimes 'public_html' or 'htdocs' is used instead of 'httpdocs'.
AUTO_INSTALL=You are using the self-contained installation ocPortal package. In order to install from this, you must give your FTP details so that the package may transfer your files with the correct permissions.
PHP_OLD=PHP version 4.1 or newer is required
MANUAL_CHMOD_TMP_FILE=You need to manually grant full write and directory access permission to the temporary directory that has been created on your web server. If it already has these permissions, try assigning them to its parent directory also (known problem on Mosso Cloud service). Unfortunately the installer has not been able to automate this.
NO_UPLOAD=PHP must have file uploading enabled
INSTALLER={1} installer
INSTALLER_STEP=step {1} of {2}
TERMS=By installing ocPortal you agree to the terms in the licence. Please read them carefully.
WELCOME_A=Welcome to the ocPortal installer. This script will install the ocPortal software on your server. Before you continue, please make sure that you have followed all of the instructions laid out in the {1}.
WELCOME_B=Install guide
CAREFUL=This installer will leave your separate forum database untouched (if you are using a forum driver that uses one), with the small exception that some member account changes are made.
DB_CHOICE=<strong>Advanced</strong>. Your database of choice (should be installed on the/a server)
FORUM_CHOICE=Please indicate the forum/membership system you intend to use for your site below. We recommend you use our built-in forum, and we have bundled importers for all the forums listed here so that you can install with our forum and then import your other software later. With the exception of the &lsquo;(No Forums or members)&rsquo; and &lsquo;ocPortal's own forum&rsquo; choices, this forum software must already be installed.<br /><br />If you are unsure what you wish to do, leave all the settings on this page as they are. It is very difficult to change your mind later, so try to make the best long-term choice now.
FORUM_PATH_TEXT=In order for your forum's details to be automatically detected, you need to specify where it is located on the server. This is a full server path, not an FTP path or URL path. If it is installed in an obvious location (like <kbd>/home/whatever/public_html/forums</kbd>) we should be able to automatically detect its location, however if it's installed in a not-so-obvious location or if you know exactly where it is, it's probably best to indicate that now, to save you having to configure all details manually. If PHP is configured with <kbd>open_basedir</kbd> security then this won't work across domains/subdomains, and in that case you'll need to type your settings manually.
FORUM_PATH=File-system path to <span id="sep_forum">your separate forum software</span>
_FORUM_PATH=File-system path to your separate forum software
SURE=I am sure I wish to continue
BASIC_CONFIG=Please enter your basic configuration details below. This is all required for ocPortal to install.
FORUM_DRIVER_NATIVE_LOGIN=Once installed you will log into ocPortal using your normal login. Make sure you use an administrative account (the definition of what this is different from forum to forum).
FOR_EXAMPLE=For example, {1}
TABLE_PREFIX_EXAMPLE=ocp_
TABLE_PREFIX_TEXT=The prefix your tables will be given. This allows you to have multiple ocPortal installations in a single database.
DOMAIN_EXAMPLE=example.com
DOMAIN_TEXT=You may wish to remove <kbd>www.</kbd>
MULTI_LANG=Provide support for concurrent languages
MULTI_LANG_TEXT=If you enable this, languages are abstracted so as to allow any public content to be available in multiple languages. Every text string will require an additional (simple) query if this is enabled. This option cannot be changed later.
USE_PERSISTENT=Use persistent database connections
USE_PERSISTENT_TEXT=This option may reduce the time your script takes to start, but may also tie up server resources. Check with your server operator that you may use this.
BASE_URL=Base URL
BASE_URL_EXAMPLE=http://example.com/portal
FORUM_BASE_URL_EXAMPLE=http://example.com/forum
BASE_URL_TEXT=The URL to the base of your installation. If you have multiple domain name variations (e.g. with and without <kbd>www</kbd>) then enter the one you wish to use. The base URL must start <kbd>http://</kbd>.
BASE_URL_TEXT_FORUM=The URL to the base of your existing forum installation. The base URL must start <kbd>http://</kbd>.
FILE_BASE=Base directory
FILE_BASE_EXAMPLE=/home/you/httpdocs
FILE_BASE_TEXT=The location on the server for the install directory.
COOKIE=Cookie for user
COOKIE_EXAMPLE=member_id
COOKIE_TEXT=The name of the cookie that stores the member's member ID. Cookies are pieces of data stored on users' computers, in order to provide continuity between their visits (e.g. keep them logged in).
COOKIE_PASSWORD=Cookie for password
COOKIE_PASSWORD_EXAMPLE=member_password
COOKIE_PASSWORD_TEXT=The name of the cookie that stores the member's password.
COOKIE_PATH=Cookie path
COOKIE_PATH_TEXT=Only scripts beneath this URL-path on the cookie domain may access this cookie. This should match the forum value (if you are using separate forums), and should suit both the forums and the website. It may be left blank.
COOKIE_PATH_EXAMPLE=/
COOKIE_DAYS=Cookie days
COOKIE_DAYS_TEXT=The number of days for which cookies are remembered
COOKIE_DAYS_EXAMPLE=120
COOKIE_DOMAIN=Cookie domain
COOKIE_DOMAIN_TEXT=Only scripts with this domain, or a subdomain, may access this cookie. This should match the forum value (if you are using separate forums), and should suit both the forums and the website. It may be, and probably should be, left blank. The leading <kbd>.</kbd> has a special meaning and should always be included, unless the cookie domain is blank.
COOKIE_DOMAIN_EXAMPLE=.example.com
COOKIE_PATH_MUST_MATCH=The cookie path must either be blank or correspond with some or all of the path in the base URL (that path is <kbd>{1}</kbd>).
COOKIE_DOMAIN_MUST_START_DOT=The cookie domain must either be blank or start with a dot.
COOKIE_DOMAIN_MUST_MATCH=The cookie domain must either be blank or correspond to some or all of the domain in the base URL (that domain is <kbd>{1}</kbd>). It must also start with a dot, so a valid example is <kbd>.{1}</kbd>.
COOKIE_DOMAIN_CANT_USE=You are using a non-DNS domain in your base URL, which means you will need to leave your cookie domain blank (otherwise it won't work).
FORUM_SETTINGS=Member/forum settings
_FORUM_SETTINGS={1} settings
AUTODETECT=We have attempted to auto-detect these settings from your separate forum software installation.
DATABASE_HOST=Database hostname
DATABASE_HOST_TEXT=Usually localhost
DATABASE_NAME=Database name
DATABASE_USERNAME=Database username
DATABASE_PASSWORD=Database password
OCPORTAL_SETTINGS=ocPortal settings
DUPLICATE=It is usually alright to use the same settings as for your forums. Only made them different if you really don't want them in the same database, or if the forum details above were to a shared forum in a multi-site-network (in which these details will be for your new website database).
DUPLICATE_OCF=This must be the same as the forum settings above unless the forum database you specify already exists as a live ocPortal forum (i.e. you are joining it as a multi-site-network, and the forum database is the shared database whilst this is for your new website database).
DATABASE_VALID={1} database valid
INVALID_DOMAIN=Invalid domain name given
BAD_PATH=ocPortal is not installed in the given file base path
GOOD_PATH=File path valid
FILE_PERM_GOOD=Checked file permissions

TABLES_CREATED={1} {1|table|tables} created
FORUM_DB=Forum database
SITE_DB=Site database
INSTALL_COMPLETE=Installation completed
INSTALL_LOG_BELOW=The ocPortal installation log for step {1} is below
INSTALL_LOG=Install log
FINAL_INSTRUCTIONS_A=Congratulations! ocPortal is now successfully installed!
FINAL_INSTRUCTIONS_A_SUP=The final step is to delete this file (<kbd>install.php</kbd>) from your server. This prevents other users from running this installation script, which would allow them to delete your database. As a security measure, ocPortal will not work until you delete install.php from the server. It is also a good idea to change <kbd>info.php</kbd> so it has standard file permissions for a PHP script, to prevent potentially malicious users writing into the file (i.e. remove world/group write access).
FINAL_INSTRUCTIONS_B=If you need to run this installer again, you will need to upload this file again, so you may wish to keep a copy of <kbd>install.php</kbd> on your hard drive.
FINAL_INSTRUCTIONS_C=Your ocPortal is not yet configured, which can be done at any time from the Admin Zone.
GO=Go to my new website now!
CONFIGURE=Configure my ocPortal first
THANKS=Thanks for choosing ocPortal!
INSTALL_ERROR=Unfortunately there was an error during installation. Please correct the problem then try again.
CHOOSE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=Choose a master password (this is used for configuration file maintenance: it is not attached to any username). Don't use the same password as your database password, for security reasons.
ADMIN_PASSWORD_INSECURE=Are you sure you want such an insecure master password? This will leave your installation wide open to attack.
ADVERTISE_HERE=Advertise here!
HOSTING=Get hosted by us!
DOUBLE_INSTALL_DO=Please don't click the 'Install ocPortal' button twice without at least waiting a few minutes &ndash; otherwise you will get two installs running concurrently and problems will result.
FTP_FILES_PER_GO=Number of files per cycle
DESCRIPTION_FTP_FILES_PER_GO=The number of files to FTP to the server per upload cycle. The default of 1000 is fine for most servers, but others may malfunction (such as passing a blank file to the browser for download, or giving timeout errors, or showing just a blank screen) if it is too high.
PLEASE_CHOOSE_LANG=Please choose your language
ONEWSLETTER_4=Any and all updates
ONEWSLETTER_3=Interesting updates
ONEWSLETTER_2=Important updates
ONEWSLETTER_1=Critical updates only
INVALID_FORUM_DATABASE=The forum driver can not find the forum software tables under the given database settings.<br /><strong>Are you sure you have the forum installed and gave the details correctly?</strong>
DATA_FILE_CONFLICT=The temp file the installer uses (<kbd>tmp/tmp</kbd>) is currently being written to by another process. It is likely that you have loaded this screen twice in quick succession, and a conflict just happened. Please wait a few seconds before clicking 'Refresh'/'Reload' to try again.
AUTO_IN=automatic in
MSN_FORUM_DB_NOT_OCF_ALREADY=You specified different site and forum/member databases, and chose to run the ocPortal inbuilt forum/member system, but the forum/member database is not pointing to a valid pre-existing ocPortal installation. If you specify separate settings for these then it must be, as you are telling ocPortal to join the pre-existing network around that shared member database.
