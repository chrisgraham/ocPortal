ebay_store,Third Party Integration,Kamen Blaginov,Licensed on the same terms as ocPortal,"Adds a block advertising items for sale by an eBay seller or from an eBay store.

facebook_support,Third Party Integration,Kamen / Naveen / Chris,Licensed on the same terms as ocPortal,"This addon provides substantial Facebook integration for your ocPortal website.

Features:

 - New Facebook Friends block (allows users to like your site and shows those that have)
 - New Facebook Site activity feed block
 - New Facebook Facepile block (shows people who like your site or have signed in using Facebook)
 - New Facebook 'Like button' block (linked into the main_screen_actions block by default)
 - New Facebook Comments block

For this addon to work you need to configure ocPortal's Facebook configuration settings, which includes getting a Facebook app ID.

Please be aware that this addon overrides some common templates to add Facebook functionality to them, such as [tt]LOGIN_SCREEN.tpl[/tt] and [tt]BLOCK_SIDE_PERSONAL_STATS_NO.tpl[/tt].

To use the Facebook login support your Facebook app needs to be told the domain name you are using. This is for security reasons and because it saves login cookies to this domain. It can't be a domain like 'localhost' or 'mycomputer', so if you are testing on a local computer you will need to create an imaginary domain name and link it into 127.0.0.1 via your computers 'hosts' file.

[title=""2""]How to use the Facebook friends block[/title]

The Facebook friends block adds a list of your facebook fans to your website.
Example Comcode to use it:
[code=""Comcode""][block stream=""1"" fans=""10"" logobar=""1"" param=""80430912569"" show_fanpage_link=""1"" fanpage_name=""ocPortal Fans""]main_facebook_friends[/block][/code]

'stream' is either ""1"" or ""0"" -- 1 is you would like the stream to display, 0 means you don't.

'fans' is the number of fans you want the block to display.

'show_fanpage_link' is either ""1"" or ""0"" -- 1 is you would like to display a link to the fan page, 0 means you don't.

'fanpage_name' is the name you want to display on the link to the page.

'logobar' is either ""1"" or ""0"" -- 1 is you would like to display a facebook logo on within the block, 0 means you don't.

By adding [code=""Comcode""][block]side_language[/block][/code] to a side panel of your website, you will give your users the option to translate the content of your website into another language by using Google Translate. Note that Google Translate is a paid API, so you will need to set it up as such -- enable the API in the Google Developers console, add a key (API * auth, Credentials, Create New Key), set up quote/billing for it, and then go and configure in ocPortal (Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Feature options > Google Translate). At first things will be extremely slow while the gtranslate_cache table fills up with translations for all ocPortal's language strings (you should let it run, even if it takes half an hour), but then things will speed up. This addon is intended for users serious about translation, to give a bootstrap to getting it done. If you merely want dynamic on-the-fly translation, it's best just to embed Google's standard Translate widget into your site somewhere.",,,,

Shake makes all the current visitors to your website's browser screen shake. The second makes any new messages within the shout box appear like an apparition and fly towards the current users of the site.

After installing this addon your shout box will essentially be treated as an embedded copy of the chat room linked to it. Enter/leave room messages will be saved into the room when a member goes somewhere it is shown. For that reason you may want to associate it to a chat room that isn't used independently to avoid that room being cluttered with these messages (the messages don't show in the shout box itself, as they are filtered out there). Alternatively you can blank out the language strings that provide the enter/leave room messages - ocPortal will recognise this and turn the feature off.","Javascript enabled, chat",,,

I'll give an example for news...

In the [tt]NEWS_ENTRY_SCREEN[/tt] template you'll find the action links are driven by...

[codebox]

{+START,INCLUDE,STAFF_ACTIONS}

2_REL=edit
3_URL={NEWSLETTER_URL*}
3_TITLE={+START,IF_NON_EMPTY,{NEWSLETTER_URL}}{!newsletter:NEWSLETTER_SEND}{+END}

So, you are probably thinking: what does [tt]_SEARCH:reportcontent:content_type=download:content_id={ID}:url={$SELF_URL&}[/tt] mean?
 - [tt]_SEARCH[/tt] -- look for the reportcontent module, wherever it is; you could put [tt]site[/tt] instead, it doesn't matter much
 - [tt]reportcontent[/tt] -- our reporting module that does the work
 - [tt]news[/tt] -- the content type; the name of a file in [tt]sources/hooks/systems/content_meta_aware[/tt]
 - [tt]{ID}[/tt] -- content ID; usually it's passed into a template as a parameter named 'ID' like it is here
 - [tt]{$SELF_URL&}[/tt] -- the current URL needs to be passed through

xmppchat,Development,Chris Graham,LGPL,"This addon replaces the standard ocPortal chat room with any Jabber chatrooms running on your server. Usage Instructions:
1) You will need a dedicated server; we assume it is Linux and Apache.
2) We assume ocPortal is installed to use MySQL.
3) We assume that users are set up with standard ocPortal password hashing, or md5 hashing, or plain passwords, or vbulletin hashing.
4) Install ejabberd on on your server (it supports builtin BOSH connections -- which are needed for our web interface). Make sure it's not version 1, that has problems.
5) It is important mod_http_bind has been enabled on your ejabberd configuration, as well as mod_muc (they are by default).
6) Edit ejabberd.cfg to enable the mod_muc_log module, setting the save path to be <ocpbasepath>/data_custom/jabber-logs (optional).
7) Install this ocPortal addon to replace ocPortal's normal chat backend with your new XMPP server.
8) Turn on our authentication script by editing ejabberd.cfg.... a) Comment out ""{auth_method, internal}."" b) Add in: ""<ocpbasepath>/data_custom/modules/chat/ejabberd_auth.php"" c) Set execute file permissions on the above referenced script, ""chmod a+x <ocpbasepath>/data_custom/modules/chat/ejabberd_auth.php""
9) In ocPortal you should deny access to Guests to the chat module, they are not supported at this time.
10) Instructions for XMPP usage by users have been placed on the chat lobby screen. Note that as an administrator you now need to manage chat rooms via a normal XMPP client: the admin/CMS chat modules will no longer be functional.
11) You may need to set up Proxy server (we're not sure why, but on some PHP configurations our proxying script does not work). Something similar to the following needs to be in the Apache configuration to workaround the problem: LoadModule proxy_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_proxy.so LoadModule proxy_http_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_proxy_http.so ProxyRequests Off ProxyPass /data_custom/xmpp_proxy.php http://<yourdomainname>:5280/http-bind/ Credits: We used xmpp4js to integrate with our chat frontend, and the ocP/jabber authentication was based on lissyx's work.","Dedicated server running ejabberd, chat",,Harlan Iverson,
